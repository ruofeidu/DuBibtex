Another useful tool for LaTeX writing is extracting the abstract:
<http://tool.duruofei.com/abstract>, whose source code is added as a
submodule here.

Known issues:

- It assumes the first line of each bibtex item contains its bib ID.
  This is typically true if the bibtex item is from Google Scholar or DBLP

## Run

First, edit `config.ini` and modify your list of input bib files. For example:

```sh
inputFileList       =   input.bib,test.bib
```

Next, run

```sh
python Dubibtex
```

The new bib file will be generated as output.bib by default.
