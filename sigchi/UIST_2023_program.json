      "abstract": "For grasping, tactile stimuli to multiple fingertips are crucial for realistic shape rendering and precise manipulation. Pinching is particularly important in virtual reality since it is frequently used to grasp virtual objects. However, the interaction space of tactile feedback around pinching is underexplored due to a lack of means to provide co-located but different stimulation to finger pads. We propose a double-sided electrotactile device with a thin and flexible form factor to fit within pinched fingerpads, comprising two overlapping 3 × 3 electrode arrays. Using this new tactile interface, we define a new concept of double-sided tactile interactions with three feedback modes: (1) single-sided stimulation, (2) simultaneous double-sided stimulation, and (3) spatiotemporal double-sided stimulation. Through two user studies, we (1) demonstrate that participants can accurately discriminate between single-sided and double-sided stimulation and find a qualitative difference in tactile sensation; and (2) confirm the occurrence of apparent tactile motion between fingers and present optimal parameters for continuous or discrete movements. Based on these findings, we demonstrate five VR applications to exemplify how double-sided tactile interactions can produce spatiotemporal movement of a virtual object between fingers and enrich touch feedback for UI operation.",

      "abstract": "Impact events, which generate directional forces with extremely short impulse durations and large force magnitudes, are prevalent in both virtual reality (VR) games and real-world experiences. However, despite recent advancement in ungrounded force feedback technologies, such as air jet propulsion and propellers, these technologies remain 5-100x weaker and 10-500x slower compared to real-world impact events. For instance, they can only achieve 4𝑁 with a minimal duration of 50-500𝑚𝑠 compared to the 20-400𝑁 forces generated within 1-5𝑚𝑠 for baseball, ping-pong, drumming, and tennis. To overcome these limitations, we present AirCharge, a novel haptic device that accumulates air propulsion momentum to generate instantaneous, directional impact forces. By mounting compressed air jets on rotating swingarms, AirCharge can amplify impact force magnitude by more than 10x while matching real-world impulse duration of 3𝑚𝑠. To support high-frequency impacts, we explored and evaluated a series of device designs, culminating in a novel reciprocating dual-swingarm design that leverages a reversing bevel gearbox to eliminate gyro effects and to achieve impact feedback of up to 10𝐻𝑧. User experience evaluation (n = 16) showed that AirCharge significantly enhanced realism and is preferred by participants compared to air jets without the charging mechanism.\r\n",

In this paper, we explore how authoring tools can help authors better style and label formulas to support their readability. We introduce a markup language for augmenting formulas called FFL, or \"Formula Formatting Language,\" which aims to lower the threshold to stylize and diagram formulas. The language is designed to be concise, writable, readable, and integrable into web-based document authoring environments. It was developed with an accompanying runtime that supports live application of augmentations to formulas. Our lab study shows that FFL improves the speed and ease of editing augmentation markup, and the readability of augmentation markup compared to baseline LaTeX tools. These results clarify the role tooling can play in supporting the explanation of math notation.",

      "abstract": "We propose Skinergy for self-powered on-skin input sensing, a step towards prolonged on-skin device usage. In contrast to prior on-skin gesture interaction sensors, Skinergy's sensor operation does not require external power. Enabled by the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) phenomenon, the machine-embroidered silicone-textile composite sensor converts mechanical energy from the input interaction into electrical energy. Our proof-of-concept untethered sensing system measures the voltages of generated electrical signals which are then processed for a diverse set of sensing tasks: discrete touch detection, multi-contact detection, contact localization, and gesture recognition. Skinergy is fabricated with off-the-shelf materials. The aesthetic and functional designs can be easily customized and digitally fabricated. We characterize Skinergy and conduct a 10-participant user study to (1) evaluate its gesture recognition performance and (2) probe user perceptions and potential applications. Skinergy achieves 92.8% accuracy for an 11-class gesture recognition task. Our findings reveal that human factors (e.g., individual differences in skin properties, and aesthetic preferences) are key considerations in designing self-powered on-skin sensors for human inputs.",

      "abstract": "People are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for complex information tasks like academic research or planning a move to another city. However, while they often require working in a nonlinear manner --- e.g., to arrange information spatially to organize and make sense of it, current interfaces for interacting with LLMs are generally linear to support conversational interaction. To address this limitation and explore how we can support LLM-powered exploration and sensemaking, we developed Sensecape, an interactive system designed to support complex information tasks with an LLM by enabling users to (1) manage the complexity of information through multilevel abstraction and (2) switch seamlessly between foraging and sensemaking. Our within-subject user study reveals that Sensecape empowers users to explore more topics and structure their knowledge hierarchically, thanks to the externalization of levels of abstraction. We contribute implications for LLM-based workflows and interfaces for information tasks.",

To support digital fabrication workflow development, we contribute infrastructure that prioritizes extensibility and iteration. Dynamic Toolchains are dataflow programs with event-driven feedback between interactive, stateful modules. We contribute a browser-based dataflow environment for running Dynamic Toolchains, a library of fabrication-oriented front- and back-end modules for design and machine control, and a development framework for building custom modules. Furthermore, we show how our infrastructure supports unconventional fabrication workflows with demonstrations that include interactive watercolor painting, map plotting, machine knitting, audio embroidery, textured 3d printing, and computer-controlled milling. These demonstrations show how our infrastructure supports multiple kinds of engagement including reuse, remix, and extension. Finally, we discuss how this work contributes to broader conversations in HCI on creativity across the digital/physical divide.",

      "abstract": "Pose-aware visual effects where graphics assets and animations are rendered reactively to the human pose have become increasingly popular, appearing on mobile devices, the web, or even head-mounted displays like AR glasses. Yet, creating such effects still remains difficult for novices. In a traditional video editing workflow, a creator could utilize keyframes to create expressive but non-adaptive results which cannot be reused for other videos. Alternatively, programming-based approaches allow users to develop interactive effects, but are cumbersome for users to quickly express their creative intents. In this work, we propose a lightweight visual programming workflow for authoring adaptive and expressive pose effects. By combining a programming by demonstration paradigm with visual programming, we simplify three key tasks in the authoring process: creating pose triggers, designing animation parameters, and rendering. We evaluated our system with a qualitative user study and a replicated example study, finding that all participants can create effects efficiently. ",

      "abstract": "Blind and low-vision (BLV) people face challenges watching sports due to the lack of accessibility of sports broadcasts. Currently, BLV people rely on descriptions from TV commentators, radio announcers, or their friends to understand the game. These descriptions, however, do not allow BLV viewers to visualize the action by themselves. We present Front Row, a system that automatically generates an immersive audio representation of sports broadcasts, specifically tennis, allowing BLV viewers to more directly perceive what is happening in the game. Front Row first recognizes gameplay from the video feed using computer vision, then renders players’ positions and shots via spatialized (3D) audio cues. User evaluations with 12 BLV participants show that Front Row gives BLV viewers a more accurate understanding of the game compared to TV and radio, enabling viewers to form their own opinions on players' moods and strategies. We discuss future implications of Front Row and illustrate several applications, including a Front Row plug-in for video streaming platforms to enable BLV people to visualize the action in sports videos across the Web.",

      "abstract": "We present a pipeline for printing interactive and always-on magnetophoretic displays using affordable FDM 3D printers. Using our pipeline, an end-user can convert the surface of a 3D shape into a matrix of voxels. The generated model can be sent to an FDM 3D printer equipped with an additional syringe-based injector. During the printing process, an oil and iron powder-based liquid mixture is injected into each voxel cell, allowing the appearance of the once-printed object to be editable with external magnetic sources. To achieve this, we conducted modifications to the 3D printer hardware and the firmware. We also implemented a 3D editor to prepare printable models. We demonstrate our pipeline with a variety of examples, including a printed Stanford bunny with customizable appearances, a small espresso mug that can be used as a post-it note surface, a board game figurine with a computationally updated display, and a collection of flexible wearable accessories with editable visuals.",

      "abstract": "Computing technology has deeply shaped how academic articles are written and produced, yet article formats and affordances have changed little over centuries. The status quo consists of digital files optimized for printed paper—ill-suited to interactive reading aids, accessibility, dynamic figures, or easy information extraction and reuse. Guided by formative discussions with scholarly communication researchers and publishing tool developers, we present Living Papers, a language toolkit for producing augmented academic articles that span print, interactive, and computational media. Living Papers articles may include formatted text, references, executable code, and interactive components. Articles are parsed into a standardized document format from which a variety of outputs are generated, including static PDFs, dynamic web pages, and extraction APIs for paper content and metadata. We describe Living Papers' architecture, document model, and reactive runtime, and detail key aspects such as citation processing and conversion of interactive components to static content. We demonstrate the use and extension of Living Papers through examples spanning traditional research papers, explorable explanations, information extraction, and reading aids such as enhanced citations, cross-references, and equations. Living Papers is available as an extensible, open source platform intended to support both article authors and researchers of augmented reading and writing experiences.",

      "abstract": "Everyday, billions of people use footwear for walking, running, or exercise. Of emerging interest are ``smart footwear'', which help users track gait, count steps or even analyse performance. However, such nascent footwear lack fine-grain ground surface context awareness, which could allow them to adapt to the conditions and create usable functions and experiences. Hence, this research aims to recognize the walking surface using a radar sensor embedded in a shoe, enabling ground context-awareness. Using data collected from 23 participants from an in-the-wild setting, we developed several classification models. We show that our model can detect five common terrain types with an accuracy of 80.0\\% and further ten terrain types with an accuracy of 66.3\\%, while moving. Importantly, it can detect the gait motion types such as `walking', `stepping up', `stepping down', `still', with an accuracy of 90\\%. Finally, we present potential use cases and insights for future work based on such ground-aware smart shoes.",

      "abstract": "Linework on 3D animated characters is an important aspect of stylized looks for films. We present CurveCrafter, a system allowing animators to create new lines on 3D models and to edit the shape and opacity of silhouette curves. Our tools allow users to draw, redraw, erase, edit and retime user created curves. Silhouette curves can have their shape edited or reverted, and their opacity erased or revealed. Our algorithm for propagating edits over tracked silhouette curves ensures temporal consistency even as curves expand and merge. Five professional animators used our system to animate lines on three shots with different characters. Additionally, the effects lead from the short film \"Pete\" used our system to more easily recreate edits on a film shot. CurveCrafter was able to successfully enhance the resulting animations with additional linework.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Crafting a rich and unique environment is crucial for fictional world-building, but can be difficult to achieve since illustrating a world from scratch requires time and significant skill. We investigate the use of recent multi-modal image generation systems to enable users iteratively visualize and modify elements of their fictional world using a combination of text input, sketching, and region-based filling. WorldSmith enables novice world builders to quickly visualize a fictional world with layered edits and hierarchical compositions. Through a formative study (4 participants) and first-use study (13 participants) we demonstrate that WorldSmith offers more expressive interactions with prompt-based models. With this work, we explore how creatives can be empowered to leverage prompt-based generative AI as a tool in their creative process, beyond current \"click-once\" prompting UI paradigms.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present Starrypia, a lightweight gamified music adjuvant treatment application to improve the symptoms of mild autistic children, eliminating the geographical and time constraints faced by traditional treatment. Adopting ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) behavioral theory as the principle, Starrypia follows the stimulus-response-reinforcement-pause process and incorporates music therapy and sensory integration. Based on AR, Starrypia provides multi-sensory intervention through music generated by BiLSTM deep model, 3D visual scenes, touch interaction to keep children focused and calm. We conducted a controlled experiment on 20 children to test Starrypia’s effectiveness and attraction. Children’s pre-test and post-test scores on two autism rating scales and performance during the test were applied to measure their abilities and engagement. Experimental results indicated that children showed great interest in Starrypia and presented evident symptom remission and advance in overall abilities after 4 weeks of use. In conclusion, Starrypia is practicable in both therapeutic effect and user experience, and conspicuously instrumental in promoting sensory ability.",

However, creating or retrieving images is challenging for BLV creators as it is difficult to use authoring tools or assess image search results. Thus, creators limit the types of images they create or recruit sighted collaborators. \r\nWhile text-to-image generation models let creators generate high-fidelity images based on a text description (i.e. prompt), it is difficult to assess the content and quality of generated images. We present GenAssist, a system to make text-to-image generation accessible. Using our interface, creators can verify whether generated image candidates followed the prompt, access additional details in the image not specified in the prompt, and skim a summary of similarities and differences between image candidates. \r\nTo power the interface, GenAssist uses a large language model to generate visual questions, vision-language models to extract answers, and a large language model to summarize the results. \r\nOur study with 12 BLV creators demonstrated that GenAssist enables and simplifies the process of image selection and generation, making visual authoring more accessible to all.",

      "abstract": "The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry privacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a median positional error of 11.0~cm, without the user having to provide training data.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce \\textit{MagKnitic}, a novel approach to integrate passive force feedback and binary sensing into fabrics via digital machine knitting. Our approach utilizes digital fabrication technology to enable haptic interfaces that are soft, flexible, lightweight, and conform to the user's body shape. Despite these characteristics, our interfaces provide diverse, interactive, and responsive force feedback, expanding the design space for haptic experiences. \\textit{MagKnitic} provides scalable and customizable passive haptic sensations by utilizing the attractive force between ferromagnetic yarns and permanent magnets, both of which are seamlessly integrated into knitted fabrics. Moreover, we present a binary sensing capability based on the resistance drop resulting from the activated electrical path between the integrated magnets and ferromagnetic yarn upon direct contact. We offer parametric design templates for users to customize \\textit{MagKnitic} layouts and patterns. With various design layouts and combinations, \\textit{MagKnitic} supports passive haptics interactions of linear, polar, angular, planar, radial, and user-defined motions. We perform a technical evaluation of the passive force feedback and the binary sensing capabilities with different machine knitting layouts and patterns, embedded magnet sizes, and interaction distances. In addition, we conduct two user studies to validate the effectiveness of \\textit{MagKnitic}. Finally, we demonstrate various application scenarios, including wearable input interfaces, game controllers, passive VR/AR wearables, and interactive furniture coverings.",

      "abstract": "Prior research has explored modifying taste through electrical stimulation. While promising, such interfaces often only elicit taste changes while in contact with the user’s tongue (e.g., cutlery with electrodes), making them incompatible with eating and swallowing real foods. Moreover, most interfaces cannot selectively alter basic tastes, but only the entire flavor profile (e.g., cannot selectively alter bitterness). To tackle this, we propose taste retargeting, a method of altering taste perception by delivering chemical modulators to the mouth before eating. These modulators temporarily change the response of taste receptors to foods, selectively suppressing or altering basic tastes. Our first study identified six accessible taste modulators that suppress salty, umami, sweet, or bitter and transform sour into sweet. Using these findings, we demonstrated an interactive application of this technique with the example of virtual reality, which we validated in our second study. We found that taste retargeting reduced the flavor mismatch between a food prop and other virtual foods.",

      "abstract": "Haptic interfaces have been extended to the feet to enhance foot-based activities, such as guidance while walking or stepping on virtual textures. Most feet haptics use mechanical actuators, namely vibration motors. However, we argue that vibration motors are not the ideal actuators for all feet haptics. Instead, we demonstrate that electrotactile stimulation provides qualities that make it a powerful feet-haptic interface: (1) Users wearing electrotactile can not only feel the stimulation but can also better feel the terrain under their feet—this is critical as our feet are also responsible for the balance on uneven terrains and stairs—electrotactile achieves this improved “feel-through” effect because it is thinner than vibrotactile actuators, at 0.1 mm in our prototype; (2) While a single vibrotactile actuator will also vibrate surrounding skin areas, we found improved two-point discrimination thresholds for electrotactile; (3) Electrotactile can be applied directly to soles, insoles or socks, enabling new applications such as barefoot interactive experiences or without requiring users to have custom-shoes with built-in vibration motors. Finally, we demonstrate applications in which electrotactile feet interfaces allow users to feel not only virtual information but also the real terrain under their shoes, such as a VR experience where users walk on ground props and a tactile navigation system that augments the ground with virtual tactile paving to assist pedestrians in low-vision situations.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in developing and fabricating wearable sweat sensors in recent years, as sweat contains various analytes that can provide non-invasive indications of various conditions in the body. Although recent HCI research has been looking into wearable sensors for understanding health conditions, textile-based wearable sweat sensors remain underexplored. We present BioWeave, a woven thread-based sweat-sensing on-skin interface. Through weaving single-layer and multi-layer structures, we combine sweat-sensing threads with versatile fiber materials. We identified a design space consisting of colorimetric and electrochemical sensing approaches, targeting biomarkers including pH, glucose, and electrolytes. We explored 2D and 3D weaving structures for underexplored body locations to seamlessly integrate sweat-sensing thread into soft wearable interfaces. We developed five example applications to demonstrate the design capability offered. The BioWeave sensing interface can provide seamless integration into everyday textile-based wearables and offers the unobtrusive analysis of health conditions.",

      "abstract": "Imagine being able to listen to the birds chirping in a park without hearing the chatter from other hikers, or being able to block out traffic noise on a busy street while still being able to hear emergency sirens and car honks. We introduce semantic hearing, a novel capability for hearable devices that enables them to, in real-time, focus on, or ignore, specific sounds from real-world environments, while also preserving the spatial cues. To achieve this, we make two technical contributions: 1)  we present the  first neural network that can achieve binaural target sound extraction in the presence of interfering sounds and background noise, and 2) we  design a training methodology that allows our system to generalize to real-world use. Results show that our system can operate with 20 sound classes and that our transformer-based network has a runtime of 6.56 ms on a connected smartphone. In-the-wild evaluation with participants in previously unseen indoor and outdoor scenarios shows  that our proof-of-concept system can extract the target  sounds and  generalize  to preserve the spatial cues in its binaural output. \r\n\r\nProject page with code: https://semantichearing.cs.washington.edu\r\n\r\n",

      "abstract": "Surface ornamentation is a rich component of ceramic manufacture wherein craftspeople use multiple methods to create intricate patterns on vessels. Computational fabrication can extend manual ceramic ornamentation through procedural pattern generation and automated fabrication; however, to be effective in traditional ceramics, computational fabrication systems must remain compatible with existing processes and materials. We contribute an interactive design workflow, CeramWrap, in which craftspeople can procedurally design and fabricate decorative patterned stencils tailored to radially symmetrical vessels. Our approach extends manual techniques through a workflow where craftspeople design and edit repetitive motifs directly on a 3D digital model of a vessel and then interactively adjust the unrolling of the 3D design to a 2D format suitable for digitally fabricating stencils and templates. Through a series of example artifacts, we demonstrate how our workflow generalizes across multiple vessel geometries, supports manual and digital clay fabrication, and is adaptable to different surface ornamentation methods.",

      "abstract": "While diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models provide a simple and powerful way to generate images, guiding this generation remains a challenge. For concepts that are difficult to describe through language, users may struggle to create prompts. Moreover, many of these models are built as end-to-end systems, lacking support for iterative shaping of the image. In response, we introduce PromptPaint, which combines T2I generation with interactions that model how we use colored paints. PromptPaint allows users to go beyond language and mix prompts to express challenging concepts. Just as we iteratively tune colors by the layered placement of paint on a physical canvas, PromptPaint similarly allows users to apply different prompts to different parts of the generative process and canvas areas. Through a set of studies, we characterize different approaches for mixing prompts, design trade-offs, and technical and socio-technical challenges to the use of generative models. With PromptPaint we provide insight into future steerable generative tools. ",

      "abstract": "Projections of computer languages are tools that help users interact with representations that better fit their needs than plain text. We collected 62 projections from the literature and from a design workshop and found that 60% of them can be implemented using a table, a graph or a form. However, projections are often hardcoded for specific languages and situations, and in most cases only the developers of a code editor can create or adapt projections, leaving no room for appropriation by their users. We introduce Lorgnette, a new framework for letting programmers augment their code editor with projections. We demonstrate five examples that use Lorgnette to create projections that can be reused in new contexts. We discuss how this approach could help democratise projections and conclude with future work.",

      "abstract": "The size and cost of electroencephalography (EEG) headsets have been decreasing at a steadfast pace. Cortical frontal activity is a promising input method that is also important for affect regulation. We created Joie, a joy-based EEG brain-computer interface (BCI) which uses prefrontal asymmetries associated with joyful thoughts as input to an endless runner video game. The more prefrontal asymmetries are activated, the more the character collects coins in response. In a lab study (20 participants, 15 training sessions per participant, up to two weeks of training), we found that our experiment group instructed to imagine positive music, winning awards, and similar strategies, demonstrated significantly greater ability in activating asymmetries compared to our placebo and control groups. In our analysis, Joie demonstrates the ability for frontal asymmetries to be used as input to an affective BCI and builds upon prior work in this area. In the future, training these asymmetries can teach mental strategies that have applications in mental health.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have proposed a number of automated tools to identify and improve floating-point rounding error in math- ematical expressions. However, users struggle to effectively apply these tools. In this paper, we work with novices, experts, and tool developers to investigate user needs during the expression rewriting process. We find that users follow an iterative design process. They want to compare expressions on multiple input ranges, integrate and guide various rewriting tools, and understand where errors come from. We organize this investigation’s results into a three- stage workflow and implement that workflow in a new, extensible workbench dubbed Odyssey. Odyssey enables users to: (1) diagnose problems in an expression, (2) generate solutions automatically or by hand, and (3) tune their results. Odyssey tracks a working set of expressions and turns a state-of-the-art automated tool “inside out,” giving the user access to internal heuristics, algorithms, and functionality. In a user study, Odyssey enabled five expert numerical analysts to solve challenging rewriting problems where state-of- the-art automated tools fail. In particular, the experts unanimously praised Odyssey’s novel support for interactive range modification and local error visualization.",

      "abstract": "Using VR in reclining & lying positions is getting common for users, but upward views caused by posture have to be redirected to be parallel to the ground as when users are standing. This affects users' locomotion performances in VR due to potential physical restrictions, and the visual-vestibular-proprioceptive conflict. This paper is among the first to investigate the suited locomotion methods and how reclining & lying positions and redirection affect them in such conditions. A user-elicitation study was carried out to construct a set of locomotion methods based on users' preferences when they were in different reclining & lying positions. A second study developed user-preferred 'tapping' and 'chair rotating' gestures, by evaluating their performances at various body reclining angles, we measured the general impacts of posture and redirection. The results showed that these methods worked effectively, but exposed some shortcomings, and users performed worst at 45-degree reclining angles. Finally, four upgraded methods were designed and verified to improve the locomotion performances.",

      "abstract": "We introduce RealityCanvas, a mobile AR sketching tool that can easily augment real-world physical motion with responsive hand-drawn animation. Recent research in AR sketching tools has enabled users to not only embed static drawings into the real world but also dynamically animate them with physical motion. However, existing tools often lack the flexibility and expressiveness of possible animations, as they primarily support simple line-based geometry. To address this limitation, we explore both expressive and improvisational AR sketched animation by introducing a set of responsive scribble animation techniques that can be directly embedded through sketching interactions: 1) object binding, 2) flip-book animation, 3) action trigger, 4) particle effects, 5) motion trajectory, and 6) contour highlight. These six animation effects were derived from the analysis of 172 existing video-edited scribble animations. We showcase these techniques through various applications, such as video creation, augmented education, storytelling, and AR prototyping. The results of our user study and expert interviews confirm that our tool can lower the barrier to creating AR-based sketched animation, while allowing creative, expressive, and improvisational AR sketching experiences.

      "abstract": "Academic writing in English can be challenging for non-native English speakers (NNESs). AI-powered rewriting tools can potentially improve NNESs' writing outcomes at a low cost. However, whether and how NNESs make valid assessments of the revisions provided by these algorithmic recommendations remains unclear. We report a study where NNESs leverage an AI-powered rewriting tool, Langsmith, to polish their drafted academic essays. We examined the participants' interactions with the tool via user studies and interviews. Our data reveal that most participants used Langsmith in combination with other tools, such as machine translation (MT), and those who used MT had different ways of understanding and evaluating Langsmith's suggestions than those who did not. Based on these findings, we assert that NNESs' quality assessment in AI-powered rewriting tools is influenced by the simultaneous use of multiple tools, offering valuable insights into the design of future rewriting tools for NNESs.",

TouchType-GAN in-\r\ntroduces a variational generator that estimates Gaussian Distribu-\r\ntions for every target letter to prevent mode collapse. Our experi-\r\nments on a dataset with 3k typed sentences show that TouchType-\r\nGAN outperforms existing touch typing models, including the Ro-\r\ntational Dual Gaussian model for simulating the distribution\r\nof touch points, and the Finger-Fitts Euclidean Model for sim-\r\nulating typing time. Overall, our research demonstrates that the\r\nproposed GAN structure can learn the distribution of user typed\r\ntouch points, and the resulting TouchType-GAN can also estimate\r\ntyping movements.

Real-world programming, however, requires performing multiple tasks in concert, calling for the use of multiple tools alongside conventional code. Programmers lack environments capable of composing live & rich tools to support these situations. To enable this composition, we contribute Engraft, a component-based API that allows live & rich tools to be embedded within larger environments like computational notebooks. Through recursive embedding of components, Engraft enables several new forms of composition: not only embedding tools inside environments, but also embedding environments within each other and embedding tools and environments in the outside world, including conventional codebases. We demonstrate Engraft with examples from diverse domains, including web-application development, command-line scripting, and physics education. By providing composability, Engraft can help cultivate a cycle of use and innovation in live & rich programming.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new approach for online UI adaptation that aims to overcome the limitations of the most commonly used UI optimization method involving multiple objectives: weighted sum optimization. Weighted sums are highly sensitive to objective formulation, limiting the effectiveness of UI adaptations. We propose ParetoAdapt, an adaptation approach that uses online multi-objective optimization with a posteriori articulated preferences---that is, articulation of preferences after the optimization has concluded to make UI adaptation robust to incomplete and inaccurate objective formulations. It offers users a flexible way to control adaptations by selecting from a set of Pareto optimal adaptation proposals and adjusting them to fit their needs. We showcase the feasibility and flexibility of ParetoAdapt by implementing an online layout adaptation system in a state-of-the-art 3D UI adaptation framework. We further evaluate its robustness and run-time in simulation-based experiments that allow us to systematically change the accuracy of the estimated user preferences. We conclude by discussing how our approach may impact the usability and practicality of online UI adaptations.",

      "abstract": "With recent advances in Generative AI, it is becoming easier to automatically manipulate 3D models. However, current methods tend to apply edits to models globally, which risks compromising the intended functionality of the 3D model when fabricated in the physical world. For example, modifying functional segments in 3D models, such as the base of a vase, could break the original functionality of the model, thus causing the vase to fall over. We introduce a method for automatically segmenting 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements. This method allows users to selectively modify aesthetic segments of 3D models, without affecting the functional segments. To develop this method we first create a taxonomy of functionality in 3D models by qualitatively analyzing 1000 models sourced from a popular 3D printing repository, Thingiverse. With this taxonomy, we develop a semi-automatic classification method to decompose 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements. We propose a system called Style2Fab that allows users to selectively stylize 3D models without compromising their functionality. We evaluate the effectiveness of our classification method compared to human-annotated data, and demonstrate the utility of Style2Fab with a user study to show that functionality-aware segmentation helps preserve model functionality.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Existing invisible object tagging methods are prone to low resolution, which impedes tracking performance. We present BrightMarker, a fabrication method that uses fluorescent filaments to embed easily trackable markers in 3D printed color objects. By using an infrared-fluorescent filament that \"shifts\" the wavelength of the incident light, our optical detection setup filters out all the noise to only have the markers present in the infrared camera image. The high contrast of the markers allows us to track them robustly regardless of the moving objects’ surface color.\r\n\r\nWe built a software interface for automatically embedding these markers for the input object geometry, and hardware modules that can be attached to existing mobile devices and AR/VR headsets. Our image processing pipeline robustly localizes the markers in real-time from the captured images.\r\n\r\nBrightMarker can be used in a variety of applications, such as custom fabricated wearables for motion capture, tangible interfaces for AR/VR, rapid product tracking, and privacy-preserving night vision. BrightMarker exceeds the detection rate of state-of-the-art invisible marking, and even small markers (1\"x1\") can be tracked at distances exceeding 2m.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, with growing health consciousness, at-home workout has become increasingly popular for its convenience and safety. Most people choose to follow video guidance during exercising. However, our preliminary study revealed that fitness-minded people face challenges when watching exercise videos on handheld devices or fixed monitors, such as limited movement comprehension due to static camera angles and insufficient feedback. To address these issues, we reviewed popular workout videos, identified user requirements, and came up with an augmented reality (AR) solution. Following a user-centered iterative design process, we proposed a design space of AR visual cues for workouts and implemented an AR-based application. Specifically, we captured users’ exercise performance with pose-tracking technology and provided feedback via AR visual cues. Two user experiments showed that incorporating AR visual cues could improve movement comprehension and enable users to adjust their movements based on real-time feedback. Finally, we presented several suggestions to inspire future design and apply AR visual cues to sports training.",

      "abstract": "While text entry is an essential and frequent task in Augmented Reality (AR) applications, devising an efficient and easy-to-use text entry method for AR remains an open challenge. This research presents STAR, a smartphone-analogous AR text entry technique that leverages a user's familiarity with smartphone two-thumb typing. With STAR, a user performs thumb typing on a virtual QWERTY keyboard that is overlain on the skin of their hands. During an evaluation study of STAR, participants achieved a mean typing speed of 21.9 WPM (i.e., 56% of their smartphone typing speed), and a mean error rate of 0.3% after 30 minutes of practice. We further analyze the major factors implicated in the performance gap between STAR and smartphone typing, and discuss ways this gap could be narrowed.",

In particular, we explore the potential of a swarm of tabletop robots as an instance of programmable actuated fidgeting as robots are becoming increasingly available. Through ideation sessions among researchers and feedback from the participants, we formulate the design space for SwarmFidget, where swarm robots are used to facilitate programmable actuated fidgeting. To gather user impressions, we conducted an exploratory study where we introduced the concept of SwarmFidget to twelve participants and had them experience and provide feedback on six example fidgeting interactions. Our study demonstrates the potential of SwarmFidget for facilitating fidgeting interaction and provides insights and guidelines for designing effective and engaging fidgeting interactions with swarm robots. We believe our work can inspire future research in the area of programmable actuated fidgeting and open up new opportunities for designing novel swarm robot-based fidgeting systems.",

      "abstract": "Text-to-image generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images based on textual prompts. However, crafting prompts that accurately capture the user's creative intent remains challenging. It often involves laborious trial-and-error procedures to ensure that the model interprets the prompts in alignment with the user's intention. To address these challenges, we present Promptify, an interactive system that supports prompt exploration and refinement for text-to-image generative models. Promptify utilizes a suggestion engine powered by large language models to help users quickly explore and craft diverse prompts. Our interface allows users to organize the generated images flexibly, and based on their preferences, Promptify suggests potential changes to the original prompt. This feedback loop enables users to iteratively refine their prompts and enhance desired features while avoiding unwanted ones. Our user study shows that Promptify effectively facilitates the text-to-image workflow, allowing users to create visually appealing images on their first attempt while requiring significantly less cognitive load than a widely-used baseline tool.\r\n",

      "abstract": "As the use of hand gestures becomes increasingly prevalent in virtual reality (VR) applications, prototyping Compound Freehand Interactions (CFIs) effectively and efficiently has become a critical need in the design process. Compound Freehand Interaction (CFI) is a sequence of freehand interactions where each sub-interaction in the sequence conditions the next. Despite the need for interactive prototypes of CFI in the early design stage, creating them is effortful and remains a challenge for designers since it requires a highly technical workflow that involves programming the recognizers, system responses and conditionals for each sub-interaction. To bridge this gap, we present GestureCanvas, a freehand interaction-based immersive prototyping system that enables a rapid, end-to-end, and code-free workflow for designing, testing, refining, and subsequently deploying CFI by leveraging the three pillars of interaction models: event-driven state machine, trigger-action authoring, and programming by demonstration. The design of GestureCanvas includes three novel design elements — (i) appropriating the multimodal recording of freehand interaction into a CFI authoring workspace called Design Canvas, (ii) semi-automatic identification of the input trigger logic from demonstration to reduce the manual effort of setting up triggers for each sub-interaction, (iii) on the fly testing for independently validating the input conditionals in-situ. We validate the workflow enabled by GestureCanvas through an interview study with professional designers and evaluate its usability through a user study with non-experts. Our work lays the foundation for advancing research on immersive prototyping systems allowing even highly complex gestures to be easily prototyped and tested within VR environments.",

      "abstract": "In cinematic VR, viewers can only see a limited portion of the scene at any time. As a result, they may miss important events outside their field of view. While there are many techniques which offer spatial guidance (where to look), there has been little work on temporal guidance (when to look). Temporal guidance offers viewers a look-ahead time and allows viewers to plan their head motion for important events. This paper introduces spatiotemporal visual guidance and presents a new widget, RadarVR, which shows both spatial and temporal information of regions of interest (ROIs) in a video. Using RadarVR, we conducted a study to investigate the impact of temporal guidance and explore trade-offs between spatiotemporal and spatial-only visual guidance. Results show spatiotemporal feedback allows users to see a greater percentage of ROIs, with 81% more seen from their initial onset. We discuss design implications for future work in this space.",

In particular, we focus on interacting with distant virtual objects using a smartphone in a through-plane manner and present a novel selection technique that overcomes the binocular parallax that occurs in such an arrangement. In our proposed technique, when a user in the stereoscopic viewing mode needs to perform a distant selection, the user brings the fingertip near the screen of the mobile device, triggering a smoothly animated transition to the monoscopic touching mode. Using a novel proof-of-concept implementation that utilizes a transparent acrylic panel, we conducted a user study and found that the proposed technique is significantly quicker, more precise, more direct, and more intuitive compared to the ray casting baseline. Subsequently, we created VR applications that explore the rich and interesting use cases of the proposed technique.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the backbone of numerous writing interfaces with the goal of supporting end-users across diverse writing tasks. While LLMs reduce the effort of manual writing, end-users may need to experiment and iterate with various generation configurations (e.g., inputs and model parameters) until results meet their goals. However, these interfaces are not designed for experimentation and iteration, and can restrict how end-users track, compare, and combine configurations. In this work, we present \"cells, generators, and lenses\", a framework to designing interfaces that support interactive objects that embody configuration components (i.e., input, model, output). Interface designers can apply our framework to produce interfaces that enable end-users to create variations of these objects, combine and recombine them into new configurations, and compare them in parallel to efficiently iterate and experiment with LLMs. To showcase how our framework generalizes to diverse writing tasks, we redesigned three different interfaces—story writing, copywriting, and email composing—and, to demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting end-users, we conducted a comparative study (N=18) where participants used our interactive objects to generate and experiment more. Finally, we investigate the usability of the framework through a workshop with designers (N=3) where we observed that our framework served as both bootstrapping and inspiration in the design process.\r\n",

      "abstract": "We contribute a technical solution to reduce print time and material with unmodified fused deposition modelling printers. The approach uses ad hoc objects inserted by a user during printing as a replacement for printed support of overhanging structures. Examples of objects include household items like books, toy bricks, and custom mechanisms like a screw jack. A software-only system is integrated into existing slicing software to analyze generated support print paths, search a library of objects to find suitable replacements, optimize combinations of replacement objects, and make necessary adjustments to impacted printing layers and paths. During printing, the user is prompted to insert objects with the help of lightweight printed holders to guide placement and prevent movement. Instructions printed on the build-plate help identify and position objects. A technical evaluation measures performance and benefits with different sets of ad hoc objects and different levels of user involvement.",

      "abstract": "In the era of Big Data, web automation is frequently used by data scientists, domain experts, and programmers to complete time-consuming data collection tasks. However, developing web automation scripts requires familiarity with a programming language and HTML, which remains a key learning barrier for non-expert users. We provide MIWA, a mixed-initiative web automation system that enables users to create web automation scripts by demonstrating what content they want from the targeted websites. Compared to existing web automation tools, MIWA helps users better understand a generated script and build trust in it by (1) providing a step-by-step explanation of the script's behavior with visual correspondence to the target website, (2) supporting greater autonomy and control over web automation via step-through debugging and fine-grained demonstration refinement, and (3) automatically detecting potential corner cases that are handled improperly by the generated script. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 24 participants and compared MIWA with Rousillon, a state-of-the-art web automation tool. Results showed that, compared to Rousillon, MIWA reduced the task completion time by half while helping participants gain more confidence in the generated script.",

      "abstract": "Companies and organizations rely on behavioral analytics tools like Google Analytics to monitor their digital experiences. Making sense of the data these tools capture, however, requires manual event tagging and filtering---often a tedious process. Prior research approaches have trained machine learning models to automatically tag interaction data, but they draw from fixed digital experience vocabularies which cannot be easily augmented or customized. This paper introduces a novel machine learning feedback loop that generates customized tag predictions for organizations. The approach uses a general experience vocabulary to bootstrap initial tag predictions on interactive Sankey diagrams representing user navigation paths on a digital asset. By interacting with the path visualization, organizations can manually revise predictions. The system leverages this feedback to refine an organization's experience ontology, computing custom word embeddings for each of its terms via vector space refinement algorithms. The updates made to the custom experience ontology and its associated word embeddings result in better event tag predictions for that organization in the future. We conducted a needfinding interview with web analytics professionals to ground our design choices, and present a real-world deployment that demonstrates how, even with just a few training examples, custom tags can be predicted over new data.",

      "abstract": "As electronic textiles have become more advanced in sensing, ac- tuating, and manufacturing, incorporating smartness into fabrics has become of special interest to ubiquitous computing and interac- tion researchers and designers. However, innovating smart textile interfaces for numerous input and output modalities usually re- quires expert-level knowledge of specific materials, fabrication, and protocols. This paper presents EmTex, a construction kit based on embroidered textiles, patterned with dedicated sensing, actuating, and connecting components to facilitate the design and prototyp- ing of smart textile interfaces. With machine embroidery, EmTex is compatible with a wide range of threads and underlay fabrics, proficient in various stitches to control the electric parameters, and capable of integrating versatile and reliable interaction functionali- ties with aesthetic patterns and precise designs. EmTex consists of 28 textile-based sensors, actuators, connectors, and displays, pre- sented with standardized visual and tactile effects. Along with a visual programming tool, EmTex enables the prototyping of every- day textile interfaces for diverse life-living scenarios, that embody their touch input, and visual and haptic output properties. With EmTex, we conducted a workshop and invited 25 designers and makers to create freeform textile interfaces. Our findings revealed that EmTex helped the participants explore novel interaction oppor- tunities with various smart textile prototypes. We also identified challenges EmTex shall face for practical use in promoting the design innovation of smart textiles.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents LangAware, a collaborative approach for constructing personalized context for context-aware applications. The need for personalization arises due to significant variations in context between individuals based on scenarios, devices, and preferences. However, there is often a notable gap between humans and machines in the understanding of how contexts are constructed, as observed in trigger-action programming studies such as IFTTT. LangAware enables end-users to participate in establishing contextual rules in-situ using natural language. The system leverages large language models (LLMs) to semantically connect low-level sensor detectors to high-level contexts and provide understandable natural language feedback for effective user involvement. We conducted a user study with 16 participants in real-life settings, which revealed an average success rate of 87.50% for defining contextual rules in a variety of 12 campus scenarios, typically accomplished within just two modifications. Furthermore, users reported a better understanding of the machine's capabilities by interacting with LangAware.",

      "abstract": "Living bio-materials are increasingly used in HCI for fabricating objects by growing. However, how to integrate electronics to make these objects interactive still needs to be clarified. This paper presents an exploration of the fabrication design space of Biohybrid Interactive Devices, a class of interactive devices fabricated by merging electronic components and living organisms. From the exploration of this space using bacterial cellulose, we outline a fabrication framework centered on the biomaterials‘ life cycle phases. We introduce a set of novel fabrication techniques for embedding conductive elements, sensors, and output components through biological (e.g. bio-fabrication and bio-assembling) and digital processes. We demonstrate the combinatory aspect of the framework by realizing three tangible, wearable, and shape-changing interfaces. Finally, we discuss the sustainability of our approach, its limitations, and the implications for bio-hybrid systems in HCI.",

      "abstract": "Utilizing everyday objects as tangible proxies for Augmented Reality (AR) provides users with haptic feedback while interacting with virtual objects. Yet, existing methods focus on the attributes of the objects, constraining the possible proxies and yielding inconsistency in user experience. Therefore, we propose Ubi-TOUCH, an AR system that assists users in seeking a wider range of tangible proxies for AR applications based on the hand-object interaction (HOI) they desire. Given the target interaction with a virtual object, the system scans the users' vicinity and recommends object proxies with similar interactions. Upon user selection, the system simultaneously tracks and maps users' physical HOI to the virtual HOI, adaptively optimizing object 6 DoF and the hand gesture to provide consistency between the interactions. We showcase promising use cases of Ubi-TOUCH, such as remote tutorials, AR gaming, and Smart Home control. Finally, we evaluate the performance and usability of Ubi-TOUCH with a user study.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models have been trained to predict semantic information about user interfaces (UIs) to make apps more accessible, easier to test, and to automate. Currently, most models rely on datasets that are collected and labeled by human crowd-workers, a process that is costly and surprisingly error-prone for certain tasks. For example, it is possible to guess if a UI element is “tappable” from a screenshot (i.e., based on visual signifiers) or from potentially unreliable metadata (e.g., a view hierarchy), but one way to know for certain is to programmatically tap the UI element and observe the effects. We built the Never-ending UI Learner, an app crawler that automatically installs real apps from a mobile app store and crawls them to discover new and challenging training examples to learn from. The Never-ending UI Learner has crawled for more than 5,000 device-hours, performing over half a million actions on 6,000 apps to train three computer vision models for i) tappability prediction, ii) draggability prediction, and iii) screen similarity.",

      "abstract": "The neural radiance field (NeRF) is attracting increasing attentions from researchers in various fields. While NeRF has produced visu- ally plausible results and found its potential applications in virtual reality, users are only allowed to rotate the camera to observe the scene represented as NeRF. We study the haptic interaction with NeRF models in this paper to enable the experience of touching ob- jects reconstructed by NeRF. Existing haptic rendering algorithms do not work well for NeRF-represented models because NeRF is of- ten noisy. We propose a stochastic haptic rendering method to deal with the collision response between the haptic proxy and NeRF. We validate our method with complex NeRF models and experimental results show the efficacy of our proposed algorithm.\r\n",

      "abstract": "In argumentative writing, writers must brainstorm hierarchical writing goals, ensure the persuasiveness of their arguments, and revise and organize their plans through drafting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made interactive text generation through a chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT) possible. However, this approach often neglects implicit writing context and user intent, lacks support for user control and autonomy, and provides limited assistance for sensemaking and revising writing plans. To address these challenges, we introduce VISAR, an AI-enabled writing assistant system designed to help writers brainstorm and revise hierarchical goals within their writing context, organize argument structures through synchronized text editing and visual programming, and enhance persuasiveness with argumentation spark recommendations. VISAR allows users to explore, experiment with, and validate their writing plans using automatic draft prototyping. A controlled lab study confirmed the usability and effectiveness of VISAR in facilitating the argumentative writing planning process.",

Web automation increases productivity, but translating tasks to web actions accurately and extending to new specifications is challenging. Existing tools can automate tasks that perform the same logical trace of UI actions (e.g., input text in each field in order), but do not support tasks requiring different executions based on varied input conditions. We present DiLogics, a programming-by-demonstration system that utilizes NLP to assist users in creating web automation programs that handle diverse specifications. DiLogics first semantically segments input data to structured task steps. By recording user demonstrations for each step, DiLogics generalizes the web macros to novel but semantically similar task requirements. Our evaluation showed that non-experts can effectively use DiLogics to create automation programs that fulfill diverse input instructions. DiLogics provides an efficient, intuitive, and expressive method for developing web automation programs satisfying diverse specifications.",

      "abstract": "Vocabulary learning support tools have widely exploited existing materials, e.g., stories or video clips, as contexts to help users memorize each target word. However, these tools could not provide a coherent context for any target words of learners’ interests, and they seldom help practice word usage. In this paper, we work with teachers and students to iteratively develop Storyfier, which lever- ages text generation models to enable learners to read a generated story that covers any target words, conduct a story cloze test, and use these words to write a new story with adaptive AI assistance. Our within-subjects study (N=28) shows that learners generally favor the generated stories for connecting target words and writ- ing assistance for easing their learning workload. However, in the read-cloze-write learning sessions, participants using Storyfier per- form worse in recalling and using target words than learning with a baseline tool without our AI features. We discuss insights into supporting learning tasks with generative models.",

      "abstract": "Knitting machines can fabricate complex fabric structures using robust industrial fabrication machines. However, machine knitting's full capabilities are only available through low-level programming languages that operate on individual machine operations. We present KnitScript, a domain-specific machine knitting scripting language that supports computationally driven knitting designs. KnitScript provides a comprehensive virtual model of knitting machines, giving access to machine-level capabilities as they are needed while automating a variety of tedious and error-prone details. Programmers can extend KnitScript with Python programs to create more complex programs and user interfaces. We evaluate the expressivity of KnitScript through a user study where nine machine knitters used KnitScript code to modify knitting patterns. We demonstrate the capabilities of KnitScript through three demonstrations where we create: a program for generating knitted figures of randomized trees, a parameterized hat template that can be modified with accessibility features, and a pattern for a parametric mixed-material lampshade. KnitScript advances the state of machine-knitting research by providing a platform to develop and share complex knitting algorithms, design tools, and patterns. ",

      "abstract": "Researchers who build creativity support tools (CSTs) define abstractions and software representations that align with user needs to give users the power to accomplish tasks. However, these specifications also structure and limit how users can and should think, act, and express themselves. Thus, tool designers unavoidably exert power over their users by enacting a ``normative ground'' through their tools. Drawing on interviews with 11 creative practitioners, tool designers, and CST researchers, we offer a definition of empowerment in the context of creative practice, build a preliminary theory of how power relationships manifest in CSTs, and explain why researchers have had trouble addressing these concepts in the past. We re-examine CST literature through a lens of power and argue that mitigating power imbalances at the level of technical design requires enabling users in both vertical movement along levels of abstraction as well as horizontal movement between tools through interoperable representations. A lens of power is one possible orientation that lets us recognize the methodological shifts required towards building ``artistic support tools.'' ",

      "abstract": "We introduce an end-to-end interactive system for mental face reconstruction - the challenging task of visually reconstructing a face image a person only has in their mind.\r\nIn contrast to existing methods that suffer from low usability and high mental load, our approach only requires the user to rank images over multiple iterations according to the perceived similarity with their mental image.\r\nBased on these rankings, our mental face reconstruction system extracts image features in each iteration, combines them into a joint feature vector, and then uses a generative model to visually reconstruct the mental image.\r\nTo avoid the need for collecting large amounts of human training data, we further propose a computational user model that can simulate human ranking behaviour using data from an online crowd-sourcing study (N=215).\r\nResults from a 12-participant user study show that our method can reconstruct mental images that are visually similar to existing approaches but has significantly higher usability, lower perceived workload, and is 40% faster. \r\nIn addition, results from a third 22-participant lineup study in which we validated our reconstructions on a face ranking task show a identification rate of 55.3%, which is in line with prior work.\r\nThese results represent an important step towards new interactive intelligent systems that can robustly and effortlessly reconstruct a user's mental image.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces HoloBots, a mixed reality remote collaboration system that augments holographic telepresence with synchronized mobile robots. \r\nBeyond existing mixed reality telepresence, HoloBots lets remote users not only be visually and spatially present, but also \\textit{physically} engage with local users and their environment. HoloBots allows the users to touch, grasp, manipulate, and interact with the remote physical environment as if they were co-located in the same shared space. \r\nWe achieve this by synchronizing holographic user motion (Hololens 2 and Azure Kinect) with tabletop mobile robots (Sony Toio).\r\nBeyond the existing physical telepresence, HoloBots contributes to an exploration of broader design space, such as object actuation, virtual hand physicalization, world-in-miniature exploration, shared tangible interfaces, embodied guidance, and haptic communication. \r\nWe evaluate our system with twelve participants by comparing it with hologram-only and robot-only conditions. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm that our system significantly enhances the level of co-presence and shared experience, compared to the other conditions.",

      "abstract": "We present MARS (Metadata Augmented Real-time Streaming), a system that enables game-aware streaming interfaces for Twitch. Current streaming interfaces provide a video stream of gameplay and a chat channel for conversation, but do not allow viewers to interact with game content independently from the steamer or other viewers. With MARS, a Unity game’s metadata is rendered in real-time onto a Twitch viewer’s interface. The metadata can then power viewer-side interfaces that are aware of the streamer’s game activity and provide new capacities for viewers. Use cases include providing contextual information (e.g. clicking on a unit to learn more), improving accessibility (e.g. slowing down text presentation speed), and supporting novel stream-based game designs (e.g. asymmetric designs where the viewers know more than the streamer). We share the details of MARS’ architecture and capabilities in this paper, and showcase a working prototype for each of our three proposed use cases.",

      "abstract": "The amount of e-waste generated by discarding devices is enormous but options for recycling remain limited. However, inside a discarded device (from consumer devices to one’s own prototypes), an electronics designer could find dozens to thousands of reusable components, including microcontrollers, sensors, voltage regulators, etc. Despite this, existing electronic design tools assume users will buy all components anew. To tackle this, we propose ecoEDA, an interactive tool that enables electronics designers to explore recycling electronic components during the design process. We accomplish this via (1) creating suggestions to assist users in identifying and designing with recycled components; and (2) maintaining a library of useful data relevant to reuse (e.g., allowing users to find which devices contain which components). Through example use-cases, we demonstrate how our tool can enable various pathways to recycling e-waste. To evaluate it, we conducted a user study where participants used our tool to create an electronic schematic with components from torn-down e-waste devices. We found that participants’ designs made with ecoEDA featured an average of 66% of recycled components. Last, we reflect on challenges and opportunities for building software that promotes e-waste reuse.",

However, making such videos can be challenging and time-consuming as the lyrics need to be added in synchrony and visual harmony with the video. Informed by prior work and close examination of existing lyric videos, we propose a set of design guidelines to help creators make such videos. Our guidelines ensure the readability of the lyric text while maintaining a unified focus of attention. We instantiate these guidelines in a fully automated pipeline that converts an input music video into a lyric video. We demonstrate the robustness of our pipeline by generating lyric videos from a diverse range of input sources. A user study shows that lyric videos generated by our pipeline are effective in maintaining text readability and unifying the focus of attention.",

      "abstract": "Experiencing virtual environments is often limited to abstract interactions with objects. Physical proxies allow users to feel virtual objects, but are often inaccessible. We present the VoxelHap toolkit which enables users to construct highly functional proxy objects using Voxels and Plates. Voxels are blocks with special functionalities that form the core of each physical proxy. Plates increase a proxy’s haptic resolution, such as its shape, texture or weight. Beyond pro- viding physical capabilities to realize haptic sensations, VoxelHap utilizes VR illusion techniques to expand its haptic resolution. We evaluated the capabilities of the VoxelHap toolkit through the construction of a range of fully functional proxies across a variety of use cases and applications. In two experiments with 24 participants, we investigate a subset of the constructed proxies, studying how they compare to a traditional VR controller. First, we investigated VoxelHap’s combined haptic feedback and second, the trade-offs of using ShapePlates. Our findings show that VoxelHap’s proxies outperform traditional controllers and were favored by participants.",

      "abstract": "Virtual and augmented reality headsets are making significant progress in audio-visual immersion and consumer adoption. However, their haptic immersion remains low, due in part to the limitations of vibrotactile actuators which dominate the AR/VR market. In this work, we present a new approach to create high-resolution shape-changing fingerpad arrays with 20 haptic pixels/cm\\textsuperscript{2}. Unlike prior pneumatic approaches, our actuators are low-profile (5mm thick), low-power (approximately 10mW/pixel), and entirely self-contained, with no tubing or wires running to external infrastructure. We show how multiple actuator arrays can be built into a five-finger, 160-actuator haptic glove that is untethered, lightweight (207g, including all drive electronics and battery), and has the potential to reach consumer price points at volume production. We describe the results from a technical performance evaluation and a suite of eight user studies, quantifying the diverse capabilities of our system. This includes recognition of object properties such as complex contact geometry, texture, and compliance, as well as expressive spatiotemporal effects.",

      "abstract": "Blind and visually impaired (BVI) people primarily rely on non-visual senses to interact with a physical environment. Doing so requires a high cognitive load to perceive and memorize the presence of a large set of objects, such as at home or in a learning setting. In this work, we explored opportunities to enable object-centric note-taking by using a 3D printing pen for interactive, personalized tactile annotations. We first identified the benefits and challenges of self-created tactile graphics in a formative diary study. Then, we developed TacNote, a system that enables BVI users to annotate, explore, and memorize critical information associated with everyday objects. Using TacNote, the users create tactile graphics with a 3D printing pen and attach them to the target objects. They capture and organize the physical labels by using TacNote’s camera-based mobile app. In addition, they can specify locations, ordering, and hierarchy via finger-pointing interaction and receive audio feedback. Our user study with ten BVI participants showed that TacNote effectively alleviated the memory burden, offering a promising solution for enhancing users’ access to information.",

      "abstract": "Search and information retrieval systems are becoming more expressive in interpreting user queries beyond the traditional weighted bag-of-words model of document retrieval. For example, searching for a flight status or a game score returns a dynamically generated response along with supporting, pre-authored documents contextually relevant to the query. In this paper, we extend this hybrid search paradigm to data repositories that contain curated data sources and visualization content. We introduce a semantic search interface, OLIO, that provides a hybrid set of results comprising both auto-generated visualization responses and pre-authored charts to blend analytical question-answering with content discovery search goals. We specifically explore three search scenarios - question-and-answering, exploratory search, and design search over data repositories. The interface also provides faceted search support for users to refine and filter the conventional best-first search results based on parameters such as author name, time, and chart type. A preliminary user evaluation of the system demonstrates that OLIO's interface and the hybrid search paradigm collectively afford greater expressivity in how users discover insights and visualization content in data repositories.",

      "abstract": "We present FibeRobo, a thermally-actuated liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) fiber that can be embedded or structured into textiles and enable silent and responsive interactions with shape-changing, fiber-based interfaces. Three definitive properties distinguish FibeRobo from other actuating fibers explored in HCI. First, they exhibit rapid thermal self-reversing actuation with large displacements (~40%) without twisting. Second, we present a reproducible UV fiber drawing setup that produces hundreds of meters of fiber with a sub-millimeter diameter. Third, FibeRobo is fully compatible with existing textile manufacturing machinery such as weaving looms, embroidery, and industrial knitting machines. This paper contributes to developing temperature-responsive LCE fibers, a facile and scalable fabrication pipeline with optional heating element integration for digital control, mechanical characterization, and the establishment of higher hierarchical textile structures and design space. Finally, we introduce a set of demonstrations that illustrate the design space FibeRobo enables.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of voice-controlled devices in homes and enterprises, there is an urgent demand for voice identification to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and property loss. However, due to the broadcast nature of sound wave, a voice only system is vulnerable to adverse conditions and malicious attacks. We observe that the cooperation of millimeter waves (mmWave) and voice signals can significantly improve the effectiveness and security of user identification. Based on the properties, we propose a multi-modal user identification system (named WavoID) by fusing the uniqueness of mmWave sensed vocal vibration and mic-recorded voice of users. To estimate fine-grained waveforms, WavoID splits signals and adaptively combines useful decomposed signals according to correlative contents in both mmWave and voice. An elaborated anti-spoofing module in WavoID comprising biometric bimodal information defend against attacks. WavoID produces and fuses the response maps of mmWave and voice to improve the representation power of fused features, benefiting accurate identification, even facing adverse circumstances. We evaluate WavoID using commercial sensors on extensive experiments. WavoID has significant performance on user identification with over 98% accuracy on 100 user datasets.",

      "abstract": "Color filters are ubiquitous across visual digital media due to their transformative effect. However, it can be difficult to understand how a color filter will affect an image, especially for novices. In order to become experts, we argue that novices need to develop Goodwin’s notion of Professional Vision. Then, they can \"see\" and interpret their work in terms of their domain knowledge like experts. Using the theory of Professional Vision, we present two design objectives for systems that aim to help users develop expertise. These goals were used to develop Color Field, an interactive visualization of color filters as a vector field over the Hue-Saturation-Lightness color space. We conducted an exploratory user study in which five color grading novices and four experts were asked to analyze color filters. We found that Color Field enabled multiple strategies to make sense of filters (e.g. reviewing the overall shape of the vector field) and discuss them (e.g. using spatial language). We conclude with other applications of Color Field and future work to leverages Professional Vision in HCI.",

      "abstract": "Vector graphics are an industry-standard way to represent and share visual designs. Designers frequently source and incorporate styles from existing designs into their work. Unfortunately, popular design tools are not well suited for this task. We present VST, Vector Style Transfer, a novel design tool for flexibly transferring visual styles between vector graphics. The core of VST lies in leveraging automation while respecting designers' tastes and the subjectivity inherent to style transfer. In VST, designers tune a cross-design element correspondence and customize which style attributes to change. We report results from a user study in which designers used VST to control style transfer between several designs, including designs participants created with external tools beforehand. VST shows that enabling design correspondence tuning and customization is one way to support interactive, flexible style transfer.",

      "abstract": "Users often 3D model enclosures that interact with significant heat sources, such as electronics or appliances that generate heat (e.g., CPU, motor, lamps, etc.). While parts made by users might function well aesthetically or structurally, they are rarely thermally-sound. This happens because heat transfer is non-intuitive; thus, engineering thermal solutions is not straightforward. To tackle this, we developed ThermalRouter, a CAD plugin that assists with improving the thermal performance of their models. ThermalRouter automatically converts regions of the model to be made from thermally-conductive materials (such as nylon or metallic-silicone). These regions act as heat channels, branching away from hotspots to dissipate heat. The key is that ThermalRouter automatically simulates the thermal performance of many possible heat channel configurations and presents the user with the most thermally-sound design (e.g., lowest temperature). Furthermore, it allows users to customize by balancing costs, indicating non-modifiable geometry, etc. Most importantly, ThermalRouter achieves this without requiring manual labor to set up or parse the results of complex thermal simulations.",

      "abstract": "The tongue is a remarkable human organ with a high concentration of taste receptors and an exceptional ability to sense touch. This work uses electro-tactile stimulation to explore the intricate interplay between tactile perception and taste rendering on the tongue.\r\nTo facilitate this exploration, we utilized a flexible, high-resolution electro-tactile prototyping platform that can be administered in the mouth. We have created a design tool that abstracts users from the low-level stimulation parameters, enabling them to focus on higher-level design objectives. Through this platform, we present the results of three studies.\r\nOur first study evaluates the design tool's qualitative and formative aspects. In contrast, the second study measures the qualitative attributes of the sensations produced by our device, including tactile sensations and taste. In the third study, we demonstrate the ability of our device to sense touch input through the tongue when placed on the hard palate region in the mouth.\r\nFinally, we present a range of application demonstrators that span diverse domains, including accessibility, medical surgeries, and extended reality. These demonstrators showcase the versatility and potential of our platform, highlighting its ability to enable researchers and practitioners to explore new ways of leveraging the tongue's unique capabilities. Overall, this work presents new opportunities to deploy tongue interfaces and has broad implications for designing interfaces that incorporate the tongue as a sensory organ.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has become a valuable tool for social and educational purposes for autistic people, as it provides flexible environmental support to create a variety of experiences. A growing body of recent research has examined the behaviors of autistic people using sensor-based data to better understand autistic people and investigate the effectiveness of VR. Comprehensive analysis of the various signals that can be easily collected in the VR environment can promote understanding of autistic people. While this quantitative evidence has the potential to help both autistic people and others (e.g., autism experts) to understand behaviors of autistic people, existing studies have focused on single signal analysis and have not determined the acceptability of signal analysis results from the autistic person's point of view. To facilitate the use of multiple sensor signals in VR for autistic people and experts, we introduce V-DAT (Virtual Reality Data Analysis Tool), designed to support a VR sensor data handling pipeline. V-DAT takes into account four sensor modalities - head position and rotation, eye movement, audio, and physiological signals - that are actively used in current VR research for autistic people. We explain the characteristics and processing methods of the data for each modality as well as the analysis with comprehensive visualizations of V-DAT. We also conduct a case study to investigate the feasibility of V-DAT as a way of broadening understanding of autistic people from the perspectives of both autistic people and autism experts. Finally, we discuss issues with the process of V-DAT development and complementary measures for the applicability and scalability of a sensor data management system for autistic people.",

In this work, we investigate unobtrusive pressure sensing for estimating muscle tension while practicing songs with the guitar. First, we collected data from twelve guitarists. Our apparatus consisted of three pressure sensors (one on each side of the guitar pick and one on the guitar neck) to determine the sensor that is most suitable for automatically estimating muscle tension. Second, we extracted features from the pressure time series that are indicative of muscle tension. Third, we present the hardware and software design of our PressurePick prototype, which is directly informed by the data collection and subsequent analysis.",

      "abstract": "We introduce Augmented Math, a machine learning-based approach to authoring AR explorable explanations by augmenting static math textbooks without programming. To augment a static document, our system first extracts mathematical formulas and figures from a given document using optical character recognition (OCR) and computer vision. By binding and manipulating these extracted contents, the user can see the interactive animation overlaid onto the document through mobile AR interfaces. This empowers non-technical users, such as teachers or students, to transform existing math textbooks and handouts into on-demand and personalized explorable explanations. To design our system, we first analyzed existing explorable math explanations to identify common design strategies. Based on the findings, we developed a set of augmentation techniques that can be automatically generated based on the extracted content, which are 1) dynamic values, 2) interactive figures, 3) relationship highlights, 4) concrete examples, and 5) step-by-step hints. To evaluate our system, we conduct two user studies: preliminary user testing and expert interviews. The study results confirm that our system allows more engaging experiences for learning math concepts.",

      "abstract": "Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.",

      "abstract": "Creative coding tasks are often exploratory in nature. When producing digital artwork, artists usually begin with a high-level semantic construct such as a “stained glass filter” and programmatically implement it by varying code parameters such as shape, color, lines, and opacity to produce visually appealing results. Based on interviews with artists, it can be effortful to translate semantic constructs to program syntax, and current programming tools don’t lend well to rapid creative exploration. To address these challenges, we introduce Spellburst, a large language model (LLM) powered creative-coding environment. Spellburst provides (1) a node-based interface that allows artists to create generative art and explore variations through branching and merging operations, (2) expressive prompt-based interactions to engage in semantic programming, and (3) dynamic prompt-driven interfaces and direct code editing to seamlessly switch between semantic and syntactic exploration. Our evaluation with artists demonstrates Spellburst’s potential to enhance creative coding practices and inform the design of computational creativity tools that bridge semantic and syntactic spaces.",

      "abstract": "Inferential statistics are typically reported using p-values (NHST) or confidence intervals on effect sizes (estimation). This is done using a range of styles, but some readers have preferences about how statistics should be presented and others have limited familiarity with alternatives. We propose a system to interactively translate statistical reporting styles in existing documents, allowing readers to switch between interval estimates, p-values, and standardized effect sizes, all using textual and graphical reports that are dynamic and user customizable. Forty years of CHI papers are examined. Using only the information reported in scientific documents, equations are derived and validated on simulated datasets to show that conversions between p-values and confidence intervals are accurate. The system helps readers interpret statistics in a familiar style, compare reports that use different styles, and even validate the correctness of reports. Code and data: https://osf.io/x4ue7",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently soared in popularity due to their ease of access and the unprecedented ability to synthesize text responses to diverse user questions. However, LLMs like ChatGPT present significant limitations in supporting complex information tasks due to the insufficient affordances of the text-based medium and linear conversational structure. Through a formative study with ten participants, we found that LLM interfaces often present long-winded responses, making it difficult for people to quickly comprehend and interact flexibly with various pieces of information, particularly during more complex tasks. We present Graphologue, an interactive system that converts text-based responses from LLMs into graphical diagrams to facilitate information-seeking and question-answering tasks. Graphologue employs novel prompting strategies and interface designs to extract entities and relationships from LLM responses and constructs node-link diagrams in real-time. Further, users can interact with the diagrams to flexibly adjust the graphical presentation and to submit context-specific prompts to obtain more information. Utilizing diagrams, Graphologue enables graphical, non-linear dialogues between humans and LLMs, facilitating information exploration, organization, and comprehension.",

      "abstract": "Wearable devices like smartwatches and smart wristbands have gained substantial popularity in recent years. However, their small interfaces create inconvenience and limit computing functionality. To fill this gap, we propose ViWatch, which enables robust finger interactions under deployment variations, and relies on a single IMU sensor that is ubiquitous in COTS smartwatches.\r\nTo this end, we design an unsupervised Siamese adversarial learning method. We built a real-time system on commodity smartwatches and tested it with over one hundred volunteers. Results show that the system accuracy is about 97% over a week. In addition, it is resistant to deployment variations such as different hand shapes, finger activity strengths, and smartwatch positions on the wrist. We also developed a number of mobile applications using our interactive system and conducted a user study where all participants preferred our unsupervised approach to supervised calibration. The demonstration of ViWatch is shown at https://youtu.be/N5-ggvy2qfI",

      "abstract": "When software defects occur, developers begin the debugging process by formulating hypotheses to explain the cause. These hypotheses guide the investigation process, determining which evidence developers gather to accept or reject the hypothesis, such as parts of the code and program state developers examine. However, existing debugging techniques do not offer support in finding relevant hypotheses, leading to wasted time testing hypotheses and examining code that ultimately does not lead to a fix. To address this issue, we introduce a new type of debugging tool, the hypothesis-based debugger, and an implementation of this tool in Hypothesizer. Hypothesis-based debuggers support developers from the beginning of the debugging process by finding relevant hypotheses until the defect is fixed. To debug using Hypothesizer, developers first demonstrate the defect, generating a recording of the program behavior with code execution, user interface events, network communications, and user interface changes. Based on this information and the developer's descriptions of the symptoms, Hypothesizer finds relevant hypotheses, analyzes the code to identify relevant evidence to test the hypothesis, and generates an investigation plan through a timeline view. This summarizes all evidence items related to the hypothesis, indicates whether the hypothesis is likely to be true by showing which evidence items were confirmed in the recording, and enables the developer to quickly check evidence in the recording by viewing code snippets for each evidence item. A randomized controlled experiment with 16 professional developers found that, compared to traditional debugging tools and techniques such as breakpoint debuggers and Stack Overflow, Hypothesizer dramatically improved the success rate of fixing defects by a factor of five and decreased the time to debug by a factor of three.",

We present PaperToPlace, a novel workflow comprising an authoring pipeline, which allows the authors to rapidly transform and spatialize existing paper instructions into MR experience, and a consumption pipeline, which computationally place each instruction step at an optimal location that is easy to read and do not occlude key interaction areas. Our evaluations of the authoring pipeline with 12 participants demonstrated the usability of our workflow and the effectiveness of using a machine learning based approach to help extracting the spatial locations associated with each steps. A second within-subject study with another 12 participants demonstrates the merits of our consumption pipeline by reducing efforts of context switching, delivering the segmented instruction steps and offering the hands-free affordances.",

      "abstract": "Rendering haptic feedback for interactions with virtual objects is an essential part of effective virtual reality experiences. In this work, we explore providing haptic feedback for rotational manipulations, e.g., through knobs. We propose the use of a Pseudo-Haptic technique alongside a physical proxy knob to simulate various physical resistances. In a psychophysical experiment with 20 participants, we found that designers can introduce unnoticeable offsets between real and virtual rotations of the knob, and we report the corresponding detection thresholds. Based on these, we present the Pseudo-Haptic Resistance technique to convey physical resistance while applying only unnoticeable pseudo-haptic manipulation. Additionally, we provide a first model of how C/D gains correspond to physical resistance perceived during object rotation, and outline how our results can be translated to other rotational manipulations. Finally, we present two example use cases that demonstrate the versatility and power of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Tutorial videos of mobile apps have become a popular and compelling way for users to learn unfamiliar app features. To make the video accessible to the users, video creators always need to annotate the actions in the video, including what actions are performed and where to tap. However, this process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight approach Video2Action, to automatically generate the action scenes and predict the action locations from the video by using image-processing and deep-learning methods. The automated experiments demonstrate the good performance of Video2Action in acquiring actions from the videos, and a user study shows the usefulness of our generated action cues in assisting video creators with action annotation.",

      "abstract": "Methods for faithfully capturing a user's holistic pose have immediate uses in AR/VR, ranging from multimodal input to expressive avatars. Although body-tracking has received the most attention, the mouth is also of particular importance, given that it is the channel for both speech and facial expression. In this work, we describe a new RF-based approach for capturing mouth pose using an antenna integrated into the underside of a VR/AR headset. Our approach side-steps privacy issues inherent in camera-based methods, while simultaneously supporting silent facial expressions that audio-based methods cannot. Further, compared to bio-sensing methods such as EMG and EIT, our method requires no contact with the wearer's body and can be fully self-contained in the headset, offering a high degree of physical robustness and user practicality. We detail our implementation along with results from two user studies, which show a mean 3D error of 2.6 mm for 11 mouth keypoints across worn sessions without re-calibration.",

We present Riffle, a reactive state management system that achieves both simplicity and scalability by managing the entire state of a web application in a client-side persistent relational database. Data transformations over the application state are defined in a graph of reactive relational queries, providing developers with a simple spreadsheet-like reactivity model. Domain state and UI state are unified within the same system, and efficient incremental query maintenance ensures the UI remains responsive. We present a formative case study of using Riffle to build a music management application with complex data and stringent performance requirements.",

      "abstract": "SleeveIO is a modular and reconfigurable hardware platform for rapid prototyping of multimodal wearable haptic feedback interactions. SleeveIO features engineered machine-knitted sleeve and band substrates, and five categories of haptic feedback actuator modules including vibrotactors, bellows, muscles, suction/puffing cups, and quad-chamber actuators. A universal magnetic attachment mechanism unifies the different types of actuators, enabling countless multimodal haptic experiences involving combinations of different actuator types in different configurations. SleeveIO is compatible with a variety of hardware/software control platforms, such as FlowIO [42], which enables individual control of each haptic actuator and makes the system battery-powered and untethered. This paper presents the SleeveIO platform in detail along with replication resources, a novel generalized approach to making different types of haptic actuators modular and interoperable, new application possibilities enabled by SleeveIO, and a pilot assessment of the viability of the platform as a whole and each module individually.",

      "abstract": "In the art of video editing, sound helps add character to an object and immerse the viewer within a space. Through formative interviews with professional editors (N=10), we found that the task of adding sounds to video can be challenging. This paper presents Soundify, a system that assists editors in matching sounds to video. Given a video, Soundify identifies matching sounds, synchronizes the sounds to the video, and dynamically adjusts panning and volume to create spatial audio. In a human evaluation study (N=889), we show that Soundify is capable of matching sounds to video out-of-the-box for a diverse range of audio categories. In a within-subjects expert study (N=12), we demonstrate the usefulness of Soundify in helping video editors match sounds to video with lighter workload, reduced task completion time, and improved usability.",

This paper presents a novel solution to this challenge with the development of the Sustainflatable system, a self-sustaining pneumatic system that can harvest renewable energy sources such as wind, water flow, moisture, and sunlight, convert the energy into compressed air, and store it for later use in a programmable and intelligent way. The system is completely electronic-free, incorporating customized energy harvesting pumps, storage units with variable volume-pressure characteristics, and tailored valves that operate autonomously. Additionally, the paper provides a design tool to guide the development of the system and includes several environmental applications to showcase its capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Recent research in robotic proxies has demonstrated that one can automatically reproduce many non-verbal cues important in co-located collaboration. However, they often require a symmetrical hardware setup in each location. We present the VRoxy system, designed to enable access to remote spaces through a robotic embodiment, using a VR headset in a much smaller space, such as a personal office. VRoxy maps small movements in VR space to larger movements in the physical space of the robot, allowing the user to navigate large physical spaces easily. Using VRoxy, the VR user can quickly explore and navigate in a low-fidelity rendering of the remote space. Upon the robot's arrival, the system uses the feed of a 360 camera to support real-time interactions. The system also facilitates various interaction modalities by rendering the micro-mobility around shared spaces, head and facial animations, and pointing gestures on the proxy. We demonstrate how our system can accommodate mapping multiple physical locations onto a unified virtual space. In a formative study, users could complete a design decision task where they navigated and collaborated in a complex 7.5m x 5m layout using a 3m x 2m VR space. ",

      "abstract": "With appealing visual effects, kinetic typography (animated text) has prevailed in movies, advertisements, and social media. However, it remains challenging and time-consuming to craft its animation scheme. We propose an automatic framework to transfer the animation scheme of a rigid body on a given meme GIF to text in vector format. First, the trajectories of key points on the GIF anchor are extracted and mapped to the text's control points based on local affine transformation. Then the temporal positions of the control points are optimized to maintain the text topology. We also develop an authoring tool that allows intuitive human control in the generation process. A questionnaire study provides evidence that the output results are aesthetically pleasing and well preserve the animation patterns in the original GIF, where participants were impressed by a similar emotional semantics of the original GIF. In addition, we evaluate the utility and effectiveness of our approach through a workshop with general users and designers.",

      "abstract": "Haptic feedback is important for immersive, assistive, or multimodal interfaces, but engineering devices that generalize across applications is notoriously difficult. To address the issue of versatility, we propose Parametric Haptics, geometry-based tactile feedback devices that are customizable to render a variety of tactile sensations. To achieve this, we integrate the actuation mechanism with the tactor geometry into passive 3D printable patches, which are then connected to a generic wearable actuation interface consisting of micro gear motors. The key benefit of our approach is that the 3D-printed patches are modular, can consist of varying numbers and shapes of tactors, and that the tactors can be grouped and moved by our actuation geometry over large areas of the skin. The patches are soft, thin, conformable, and easy to customize to different use cases, thus potentially enabling a large design space of diverse tactile sensations. \r\nIn our user study, we investigate the mapping between geometry parameters of our haptic patches and users’ tactile perceptions. Results indicate a good agreement between our parameters and the reported sensations, showing initial evidence that our haptic patches can produce a wide range of sensations for diverse use scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with wearable prototypes in immersive Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios, embedded into wearable objects such as glasses, and as wearable navigation and notification interfaces. We support designing such patches with a design tool in Rhino.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) telepresence applications and the so-called \"metaverse\" promise to be the next major medium of human-computer interaction. However, with recent studies demonstrating the ease at which VR users can be profiled and deanonymized, metaverse platforms carry many of the privacy risks of the conventional internet (and more) while at present offering few of the defensive utilities that users are accustomed to having access to. To remedy this, we present the first known method of implementing an \"incognito mode\" for VR. Our technique leverages local ε-differential privacy to quantifiably obscure sensitive user data attributes, with a focus on intelligently adding noise when and where it is needed most to maximize privacy while minimizing usability impact. Our system is capable of flexibly adapting to the unique needs of each VR application to further optimize this trade-off. We implement our solution as a universal Unity (C#) plugin that we then evaluate using several popular VR applications. Upon faithfully replicating the most well-known VR privacy attack studies, we show a significant degradation of attacker capabilities when using our solution.",

      "abstract": "Color restoration of ancient Chinese paintings plays a significant role in Chinese culture protection and inheritance. However, traditional color restoration is challenging and time-consuming because it requires professional restorers to conduct detailed literature reviews on numerous paintings for reference colors. After that, they have to fill in the inferred colors on the painting manually. In this paper, we present PColorizor, an interactive system that integrates advanced deep-learning models and novel visualizations to ease the difficulties of color restoration. PColorizor is established on the principle of poem-painting congruence. Given a color-fading painting, we employ both explicit and implicit color guidance implied by ideorealm-congruent poems to associate reference paintings. To enable quick navigation of color schemes extracted from the reference paintings, we introduce a novel visualization based on a mountain metaphor that shows color distribution overtime at the ideorealm and imagery levels. Moreover, we demonstrate the ideorealm understood by deep learning models through intuitive visualizations to bridge the communication gap between human restorers and deep learning models. We also adopt intelligent color-filling techniques to accelerate manual color restoration further. To evaluate PColorizor, we collaborate with domain experts to conduct two case studies to collect their feedback. The results suggest that PColorizor could be beneficial in enabling the effective restoration of color-fading paintings.",

Although prior work has evaluated the comfort of microgestures performed by the index finger and thumb, these gestures cannot be performed while the fingers are constrained by specific hand locations or postures. As the hand can be freely positioned with no primary posture, partially constrained while forming a pose, or highly constrained while grasping an object at a specific location, we leverage the middle, ring, and pinky fingers to provide additional opportunities for auxiliary input across varying levels of hand constraints. A design space and applications demonstrate how such microgestures can transfer across hand location and posture constraints. An online study evaluated their comfort and effort and a lab study evaluated their use for task-specific microinteractions. The results revealed that many middle finger microgestures were comfortable, and microgestures performed while forming a pose were preferred over baseline techniques.",

      "abstract": "We present digital mechanical metamaterials that enable multiple computation loops and reprogrammable logic functions, making a significant step towards passive yet interactive devices. Our materials consist of many cells that transmit signals using an embedded bistable spring. When triggered, the bistable spring displaces and triggers the next cell. We integrate a recharging mechanism to recharge the bistable springs, enabling multiple computation rounds. Between the iterations, we enable reprogramming the logic functions after fabrication. We demonstrate that such materials can trigger a simple controlled actuation anywhere in the material to change the local shape, texture, stiffness, and display. This enables large-scale interactive and functional materials with no or a small number of external actuators. We showcase the capabilities of our system with various examples: a haptic floor with tunable stiffness for different VR scenarios, a display with easy-to-reconfigure messages after fabrication, or a tactile notification integrated into users’ desktops.",

      "abstract": "The tactile sensation of textiles is critical in determining the comfort of clothing. For remote use, such as online shopping, users cannot physically touch the textile of clothes, making it difficult to evaluate its tactile sensation. Tactile sensing and actuation devices are required to transmit the tactile sensation of textiles. The sensing device needs to recognize different garments, even with hand-held sensors. In addition, the existing actuation device can only present a limited number of known patterns and cannot transmit unknown tactile sensations of textiles.\r\nTo address these issues, we propose Telextiles, an interface that can remotely transmit tactile sensations of textiles by creating a latent space that reflects the proximity of textiles through contrastive self-supervised learning. We confirm that textiles with similar tactile features are located close to each other in the latent space through a two-dimensional plot.\r\nWe then compress the latent features for known textile samples into the 1D distance and apply the 16 textile samples to the rollers in the order of the distance. The roller is rotated to select the textile with the closest feature if an unknown textile is detected.",

      "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to transform how we work: it enables flexible and personalized workspaces beyond what is possible in the physical world. However, while most VR applications are designed to operate in a single empty physical space, work environments are often populated with real-world objects and increasingly diverse due to the growing amount of work in mobile scenarios. In this paper, we present InteractionAdapt, an optimization-based method for adapting VR workspaces for situated use in varying everyday physical environments, allowing VR users to transition between real-world settings while retaining most of their personalized VR environment for efficient interaction to ensure temporal consistency and visibility. InteractionAdapt leverages physical affordances in the real world to optimize UI elements for the respectively most suitable input technique, including on-surface touch, mid-air touch and pinch, and cursor control. Our optimization term thereby models the trade-off across these interaction techniques based on experimental findings of 3D interaction in situated physical environments. Our two evaluations of InteractionAdapt in a selection task and a travel planning task established its capability of supporting efficient interaction, during which it produced adapted layouts that participants preferred to several baselines. We further showcase the versatility of our approach through applications that cover a wide range of use cases.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Despite advancements in egocentric hand tracking using head-mounted cameras, contact detection with real-world objects remains challenging, particularly for the quick motions often performed during interaction in Mixed Reality. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for detecting touch on discovered physical surfaces purely from an egocentric perspective using optical sensing. We leverage structured laser light to detect real-world surfaces from the disparity of reflections in real-time and, at the same time, extract a time series of remote vibrometry sensations from laser speckle motions. The pattern caused by structured laser light reflections enables us to simultaneously sample the mechanical vibrations that propagate through the user's hand and the surface upon touch.\r\n\r\nWe integrated Structured Light Speckle into TapLight, a prototype system that is a simple add-on to Mixed Reality headsets. In our evaluation with a Quest 2, TapLight---while moving---reliably detected horizontal and vertical surfaces across a range of surface materials. TapLight also reliably detected rapid touch contact and robustly discarded other hand motions to prevent triggering spurious input events. Despite the remote sensing principle of Structured Light Speckle, our method achieved a latency for event detection in realistic settings that matches body-worn inertial sensing without needing such additional instrumentation. We conclude with a series of VR demonstrations for situated interaction that leverage the quick touch interaction TapLight supports.",

      "abstract": "Learning to read scientific papers critically, which requires first grasping their main ideas and then raising critical thoughts, is important yet challenging for novice researchers. The traditional ways to develop critical paper reading (CPR) skills, e.g., checking general tutorials or taking reading courses, often can not provide individuals with adaptive and accessible support. In this paper, we first derive user requirements of a CPR training tool based on literature and a survey study (N=52). Then, we develop CriTrainer, an interactive tool for CPR training. It leverages text summarization techniques to train readers’ skills in grasping the paper’s main ideas. It further utilizes template-based generated questions to help them learn how to raise critical thoughts. A mixed-design study (N=24) shows that compared to a baseline tool with general CPR guidance, students trained by CriTrainer perform better in independently raising critical thinking questions on a new paper. We conclude with design considerations for CPR training tools.",

      "abstract": "We present AirTied, a device that fabricates truss structures in a fully automatic fashion. AirTied achieves this by un-rolling a 20cm-wide inflatable plastic tube and tying nodes into it. AirTied creates nodes by holding onto a segment of tube, stacking additional tube segments on top of it, tying them up, and releasing the result. The resulting structures are material efficient and light as well as sturdy, as we demonstrate by creating a 6m-tower. Unlike the prior art, AirTied requires no scaffolding and no building blocks, bringing automated truss construction into the reach of personal fabrication.",

      "abstract": "Smart environment sensing provides valuable contextual informa- tion by detecting occurrences of events such as human activities and changes of object status, enabling computers to collect per- sonal and environmental informatics to perform timely responses to user’s needs. Conventional approaches either rely on tags that re- quire batteries and frequent maintenance, or have limited detection capabilities bounded by only a few coarsely predefined activities. In response, this paper explores corner reflector mechanisms that encode user interactions with everyday objects into structured responses to millimeter wave radar, which has the potential for integration into smart environment entities such as speakers, light bulbs, thermostats, and autonomous vehicles. We presented the design space of 3D printed reflectors and gear mechanisms, which are low-cost, durable, battery-free, and can retrofit to a wide array of objects. These mechanisms convert the kinetic energy from user interactions into rotational motions of corner reflectors which we computationally designed with a genetic algorithm. We built an end-to-end radar detection pipeline to recognize fine-grained activity information such as state, direction, rate, count, and usage based on the characteristics of radar responses. We conducted stud- ies for multiple instrumented objects in both indoor and outdoor environments, with promising results demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) became a popular method for force-feedback without mechanical-actuators. While much has been written about the advantages of EMS, not much work has investigated circumventing its key limitations: (1) as impulses traverse the skin, they cause an uncomfortable “tingling”; (2) impulses are delivered via gelled-electrodes, which not only require direct skin contact (must be worn under clothes); but, also (3) dry up after a few hours. To tackle these, we explore switching from electrical to magnetic muscle stimulation (MMS), via electromagnetic fields generated by coils. The first advantage is that MMS coils do not require direct skin contact and can actuate up to 5 cm away (Study#1)—this enables applications not possible with EMS, such as stimulation over the clothes and without ever replacing electrodes. Second, and more important, MMS results in ~50 % less discomfort caused by tingling than EMS (Study#2). We found that reducing this tingling discomfort has two downstream effects for interactive systems: (1) participants rated MMS force-feedback as more realistic than that of EMS (Study#3); and (2) participants could more accurately perceive the pose actuated by the interactive system (Study#4). Finally, we demonstrated applications where our proposed switch from EMS to MMS improves user experience, including for VR feedback, gaming, and pose-control.",

      "abstract": "Weaving is a fabrication process that is grounded in mathematics and engineering: from the binary, matrix-like nature of the pattern drafts weavers have used for centuries, to the punch card programming of the first Jacquard looms. This intersection of disciplines provides an opportunity to ground abstract mathematical concepts in a concrete and embodied art, viewing this textile art through the lens of engineering. Currently, available looms are not optimized to take advantage of this opportunity to increase mathematics learning by providing hands-on interdisciplinary learning in collegiate classrooms. In this work, we present SPEERLoom: an open-source, robotic Jacquard loom kit designed to be a tool for interweaving cloth fabrication, mathematics, and engineering to support interdisciplinary learning in the classroom. We discuss the design requirements and subsequent design of SPEERLoom. We also present the results of a pilot study in a post-secondary class finding that SPEERLoom supports hands-on, interdisciplinary learning of math, engineering, and textiles.",

      "abstract": "Audio-visual learning seeks to enhance the computer’s multi-modal perception leveraging the correlation between the auditory and visual modalities. Despite their many useful downstream tasks, such as video retrieval, AR/VR, and accessibility, the performance and adoption of existing audio-visual models have been impeded by the availability of high quality datasets. Annotating audio-visual datasets is laborious, expensive, and time consuming. To address this challenge, we designed and developed an efficient audio visual annotation tool called Peanut. Peanut’s human-AI collaborative pipeline separates the multi-modal task into two single-modal tasks, and utilizes state-of-the-art object detection and sound-tagging models to reduce the annotators’ effort to process each frame and the number of manually-annotated frames needed. A within-subject user study with 20 participants found that Peanut can significantly accelerate the audio-visual data annotation process while maintaining high annotation accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) aid in the efficient and effective composition of creative content, such as picture books. However, many existing CSTs only allow for mono-modal creation, whereas previous studies have become theoretically and technically mature to support multi-modal innovative creations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce XCreation, a novel CST that leverages generative AI to support cross-modal storybook creation. Nevertheless, directly deploying AI models to CSTs can still be problematic as they are mostly black-box architectures that are not comprehensible to human users. Therefore, we integrate an interpretable entity-relation graph to intuitively represent picture elements and their relations, improving the usability of the underlying generative structures. Our between-subject user study demonstrates that XCreation supports continuous plot creation with increased creativity, controllability, usability, and interpretability. XCreation is applicable to various scenarios, including interactive storytelling and picture book creation, thanks to its multimodal nature.",

Beyond transmitting audio, videos, and messages, we envision digital communication media as proactive facilitators that can provide unobtrusive assistance to enhance communication and collaboration. Informed by the results of a formative study, we propose three key design concepts to explore the systematic integration of intelligence into communication and collaboration, including the panel substrate, language-based intent recognition, and lightweight interaction techniques. We developed CrossTalk, a videoconferencing system that instantiates these concepts, which was found to enable a more fluid and flexible communication and collaboration experience. ",

      "abstract": "Touchscreen devices, designed with an assumed range of user abilities and interaction patterns, often present challenges for individuals with diverse abilities to operate independently. Prior efforts to improve accessibility through tools or algorithms necessitated alterations to touchscreen hardware or software, making them inapplicable for the large number of existing legacy devices. In this paper, we introduce BrushLens, a hardware interaction proxy that performs physical interactions on behalf of users while allowing them to continue utilizing accessible interfaces, such as screenreaders and assistive touch on smartphones, for interface exploration and command input. BrushLens maintains an interface model for accurate target localization and utilizes exchangeable actuators for physical actuation across a variety of device types, effectively reducing user workload and minimizing the risk of mistouch. Our evaluations reveal that BrushLens lowers the mistouch rate and empowers visually and motor impaired users to interact with otherwise inaccessible physical touchscreens more effectively.",

      "abstract": "Mobile apps bring us many conveniences, such as online shopping and communication, but some use malicious designs called dark patterns to trick users into doing things that are not in their best interest. Many works have been done to summarize the taxonomy of these patterns and some have tried to mitigate the problems through various techniques. However, these techniques are either time-consuming, not generalisable or limited to specific patterns. To address these issues, we propose UIGuard, a knowledge-driven system that utilizes computer vision and natural language pattern matching to automatically detect a wide range of dark patterns in mobile UIs. Our system relieves the need for manually creating rules for each new UI/app and covers more types with superior performance. In detail, we integrated existing taxonomies into a consistent one, conducted a characteristic analysis and distilled knowledge from real-world examples and the  taxonomy. Our UIGuard consists of two components, Property Extraction and Knowledge-Driven Dark Pattern Checker. We collected the first dark pattern dataset, which contains 4,999 benign UIs and 1,353 malicious UIs of 1,660 instances spanning 1,023 mobile apps. Our system achieves a superior performance in detecting dark patterns (micro averages: 0.82 in precision, 0.77 in recall, 0.79 in F1 score). A user study involving 58 participants further showed that UIGuard significantly increases users' knowledge of dark patterns. We demonstrated potential use cases of our work, which can benefit different stakeholders, and serve as a training tool for raising awareness of dark patterns",

      "abstract": "We present ShadowTouch, a novel sensing method to recognize the subtle hand-to-surface touch state for independent fingers based on optical auxiliary. ShadowTouch mounts a forward-facing light source on the user's wrist to construct shadows on the surface in front of the fingers when the corresponding fingers are close to the surface. With such an optical design, the subtle vertical movements of near-surface fingers are magnified and turned to shadow features cast on the surface, which are recognizable for computer vision algorithms. To efficiently recognize the touch state of each finger, we devised a two-stage CNN-based algorithm that first extracted all the fingertip regions from each frame and then classified the touch state of each region from the cropped consecutive frames. Evaluations showed our touch state detection algorithm achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.1% and an F-1 score of 96.8% in the leave-one-out cross-user evaluation setting. We further outlined the hand-to-surface interaction space enabled by ShadowTouch's sensing capability from the aspects of touch-based interaction, stroke-based interaction, and out-of-surface information and developed four application prototypes to showcase ShadowTouch's interaction potential. The usability evaluation study showed the advantages of ShadowTouch over threshold-based techniques in aspects of lower mental demand, lower effort, lower frustration, more willing to use, easier to use, better integrity, and higher confidence.",

      "abstract": "Robotic surfaces, whose form and function are under computational control, offer exciting new possibilities for environments that can be customized to fit user-specific needs. When these surfaces can be reprogrammed, a once-static structure can be repurposed to serve multiple different roles over time. In this paper, we introduce such a system. This is an architectural-scale robotic surface, which is able to begin in a neutral state, assume a desired functional shape, and later return to its neutral (flat) position. The surface can then assume a completely different functional shape, all under program control. \r\n\r\nThough designed for large-scale applications, our surface uses small, power-efficient constraints to reconfigure itself dynamically. The driving actuation force, instead of being positioned at each \"joint\" of the structure, is relocated to outer edges of the surface. Within the work presented here, we illustrate the design and implementation of such a surface, showcase a number of human-scale example functional forms that can be achieved (such as dynamic furniture), and present technical evaluations of the results.",

      "abstract": "We introduce SUPREYES – a novel self-supervised method to increase the spatio-temporal resolution of gaze data recorded using low(er)-resolution eye trackers. Despite continuing advances in eye tracking technology, the vast majority of current eye trackers – particularly mobile ones and those integrated into mobile devices – suffer from low-resolution gaze data, thus fundamentally limiting their practical usefulness. SUPREYES learns a continuous implicit neural representation from low-resolution gaze data to up-sample the gaze data to arbitrary resolutions. We compare our method with commonly used interpolation methods on arbitrary scale super-resolution and demonstrate that SUPREYES outperforms these baselines by a significant margin. We also test on the sample downstream task of gaze-based user identification and show that our method improves the performance of original low-resolution gaze data and outperforms other baselines. These results are promising as they open up a new direction for increasing eye tracking fidelity as well as enabling new gaze-based applications without the need for new eye tracking equipment.",

      "abstract": "Research consumption has been traditionally limited to the reading of academic papers—a static, dense, and formally written format. Alternatively, pre-recorded conference presentation videos, which are more dynamic, concise, and colloquial, have recently become more widely available but potentially under-utilized. In this work, we explore the design space and benefits for combining academic papers and talk videos to leverage their complementary nature to provide a rich and fluid research consumption experience. Based on formative and co-design studies, we present Papeos, a novel reading and authoring interface that allow authors to augment their papers by segmenting and localizing talk videos alongside relevant paper passages with automatically generated suggestions. With Papeos, readers can visually skim a paper through clip thumbnails, and fluidly switch between consuming dense text in the paper or visual summaries in the video. In a comparative lab study (n=16), Papeos reduced mental load, scaffolded navigation, and facilitated more comprehensive reading of papers.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have proposed a number of automated tools to identify and improve floating-point rounding error in mathematical expressions. However, users find these tools difficult to use, frequently mis-specifying their problem, misunderstanding the tools’ guarantees, or misapplying their results. In this paper, we describe an interactive design process, working with novices, experts, and tool developers to better understand users’ mental models and how those lead to issues when interacting with automated tools. We find that tools make a number of incorrect assumptions about users’ workflows, assuming that users have specific input ranges in mind, wish to work with a specific tool, and are interested in the accuracy of specific programs. Instead, we propose an ideal workflow for floating-point error improvement consisting of three steps—diagnosis, solution generation, and tuning—and identify interactive feedback cycles between these steps.Building upon this ideal workflow, we construct Odyssey, an interactive tool that puts actions for diagnosis, solution generation, and tuning close at hand, and supports an interactive use case. We find that Odyssey can reuse internal heuristics, algorithms, and functionality of existing automated tools, and is able to better support both novices and experts in floating-point error improvement. In a user study, five expert numerical analysts found Odyssey’s support for interactive range modification and local error visualization particularly helpful.",

      "abstract": "Interpersonal conflicts are often more difficult to mediate when communicating remotely. The lack of social cues and external mediation makes it difficult for positive conflict behaviors to occur. To this end, robots have been shown to have the potential as mediators. In this paper, we attempt to discuss how to design appropriate bodily contact interactions for the different roles of a robot mediator so as to facilitate the effectiveness of its mediation. We first conduct a pilot interview to probe the potential roles and design elements of robot contact in this study. Then, we explore the relationship between these roles and design elements through a 16-participant design workshop. Finally, we analyze these findings and propose design suggestions for future robot mediator design.",

These models are not only useful in large, unbroken text fields, however. We present OmniFill, a browser extension that detects text entry fields and offers “autofill”-style suggestions based on context from the browsing session. The system constructs an LLM prompt that includes three main components: (a) a description of the active tab's text fields and their current values, (b) information from the user's recent web browsing context, and (c) a history, if available, of the user's prior submissions to the web form (alongside those submissions' associated browsing context). Suggestions from the LLM's response are offered to the user to be automatically typed into each corresponding text field. We offer a motivating example of a time-saving interaction and discuss the broader utility of interface-agnostic LLM integrations.",

      "abstract": "Haptic feedback is important for immersive, assistive, or multi- modal interfaces, but engineering devices that generalize across applications is notoriously difficult. To address the issue of versatility, we propose Parametric Haptics, geometry-based tactile feedback devices that are customizable to render a variety of tactile sensations. To achieve this, we integrate the actuation mechanism with the tactor geometry into passive 3D printable patches, which are then connected to a generic wearable actuation interface consisting of micro gear motors. The key benefit of our approach is that the 3D-printed patches are modular, can consist of varying numbers and shapes of tactors, and that the tactors can be grouped and moved by our actuation geometry over large areas of the skin. The patches are soft, thin, conformable, and easy to customize to different use cases, thus potentially enabling a large design space of diverse tactile sensations.\r\nIn our user study, we investigate the mapping between geometry parameters of our haptic patches and users’ tactile perceptions. Results indicate a good agreement between our parameters and the reported sensations, showing initial evidence that our haptic patches can produce a wide range of sensations for diverse use scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with wearable prototypes in immersive Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios, embedded into wearable objects such as glasses, and as wearable navigation and notification interfaces. We support designing such patches with a design tool in Rhino.",

While parts made by users might function well aesthetically or structurally, they are rarely thermally-sound. This happens because heat transfer is non-intuitive; thus, engineering thermal solutions is not straightforward. To tackle this, we developed ThermalRouter, a CAD plugin that assists with improving the thermal performance of their models. ThermalRouter automatically converts regions of the model to be made from thermally-conductive materials (such as nylon or metallic-silicone). These regions act as heat channels, branching away from hotspots to dissipate heat. The key is that ThermalRouter automatically simulates the thermal performance of many possible heat channel configurations and presents the user with the most thermally-sound design (e.g., lowest temperature). Furthermore, it allows users to customize their solutions (e.g., balancing costs, non-modifiable geometry, etc.).

      "abstract": "People are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for complex information tasks like academic research or planning a move to another city. However, while they often require working in a nonlinear manner --- e.g., to arrange information spatially to organize and make sense of it, current interfaces for interacting with LLMs are generally linear to support conversational interaction. To address this limitation and explore how we can support LLM-powered exploration and sensemaking, we developed Sensecape, an interactive system designed to support complex information tasks with an LLM by enabling users to (1) manage the complexity of information through multilevel abstraction and (2) seamlessly switch between foraging and sensemaking. Our within-subject user study reveals that Sensecape empowers users to explore more topics and structure their knowledge hierarchically. We contribute implications for LLM-based workflows and interfaces for information tasks.",

      "abstract": "We propose SuperMagneShape, a method for creating interactive applications using MagneShape. MagneShape is a magnetically-actuated pin-based shape-changing display. It utilizes the forces produced by its magnetic components to control the levitation heights of passive magnetic pins, eliminating the need for an electric actuator for each pin. Although the MagneShape pin array is simple and inexpensive, rapid change of the magnetic pattern that drives the device is challenging. Proper display of shapes and characters requires appropriate magnetic patterns generated by a dedicated pattern generator and a time-consuming magnetization process. To minimize the complexity of the process, as well as the time taken between input and output, we designed a high-density pin array and a magnetic belt conveyor system. When the user handwrites a magnetic pattern in the shape of the letter \"A\" on a section of the magnetic belt, the imprinted magnetic pattern is conveyed under the high-density pin array and causes the pin array to display an \"A\" shape moving along it. We have also implemented games where the hand-drawn shape presents physical action as it is conveyed under the pin array. ",

      "abstract": "Color filters are ubiquitous across visual digital media due to their transformative effect. However, it can be difficult to understand how a color filter will affect an image, especially for novices. In order to become experts, we argue that novices need to develop Goodwin’s notion of Professional Vision. Then, they can \"see\" and interpret their work in terms of their domain knowledge like experts. Using the theory of Professional Vision, we present two design objectives for systems that aim to help users develop expertise. These goals were used to develop Color Field, an interactive visualization of color filters as a vector field over the Hue-Saturation-Lightness color space. We conducted an exploratory user study in which five color grading novices and four experts were asked to analyze color filters. We found that Color Field enabled multiple strategies to make sense of filters (e.g. reviewing the overall shape of the vector field) and discuss them (e.g. using spatial language). We conclude with other applications of Color Field and future work to leverages Professional Vision in HCI.",

While the display restriction is rapidly being resolved nowadays, 1D GUI is still the majority, indicating that the touch input device is the possible bottleneck. To tackle this issue by expanding the vertical input space of the temple touchpad, we propose the Virtual Rolling Temple (VRT). The concept is to perform 2D gestures by moving the hand in any direction while keep touching the prototype as if the temple rotates. The VRT touchpad is as thin as the spectacles' temples, but it provides the users with input space approximately equivalent to an 80 × 80 mm square touchpad. This is 8 and 13.9 times larger than Google Glass and VUZIX M400, respectively. To validate the concept of the VRT, we constructed three demo scenarios: 2D Pointing, 2D Menu, and 2D Gesture, to cover different types of general 2D input for smart glasses.",

Before reading an article, Marvista helps a user plan what to read by filtering text based on how much time one can spend and what questions one is interested to find out from the article. During reading, Marvista helps the user reflect on their understanding of each paragraph with AI-generated questions. After reading, Marvista generates an explainable human-AI summary that combines both AI’s processing of the text, the user’s reading behavior, and user-generated data in the reading process. In contrast to prior work that offered (content-independent) interaction techniques or devices for reading, Marvista takes a human-AI collaborative approach that contributes text-specific guidance (content-aware) to support the entire reading process.",

      "abstract": "Current gaze input methods for VR headsets predominantly utilize the gaze ray as a pointing cursor, often neglecting depth information in it. This study introduces FocusFlow, a novel gaze interaction technique that integrates focal depth into gaze input dimensions, facilitating users to actively shift their focus along the depth dimension for interaction. A detection algorithm to identify the user's focal depth is developed. Based on this, a layer-based UI is proposed, which uses focal depth changes to enable layer switch operations, offering an intuitive hands-free selection method. We also designed visual cues to guide users to adjust focal depth accurately and get familiar with the interaction process. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate the system's usability, and several potential applications are discussed. Through FocusFlow, we aim to enrich the input dimensions of gaze interaction, achieving more intuitive and efficient human-computer interactions on headset devices.",

Our approach leverages lasers as a wireless power transfer and haptic control mechanism, which can drive small actuators commonly used in AR/VR and mobile applications with DC or AC signals. To validate the feasibility of our method, we developed a proof-of-concept prototype that includes low-cost eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motors and linear resonant actuators (LRAs) connected to photovoltaic (PV) cells. This prototype enabled us to capture laser energy from any distance across a room. Through different vibration patterns rendered using either a single motor or two motors, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating vibration patterns.",

Users interact with Joie by imagining joyous thoughts and images that alter their  prefrontal EEG asymmetries. These asymmetries control their character's movement in an endless runner video game, where joyous thoughts cause left prefrontal asymmetry that leads to receiving a reward. In this demonstration, we assemble a prototype for a wearable, skin conformal polymer electrode EEG headband and evaluate this prototype with the Joie BCI. We conducted a pilot evaluation (11 participants, 3 training sessions per participant) to assess trainability and workload. We observed that our participants were able to perform relative left activation significantly greater than right activation and create single-session improvements in resting baseline asymmetry. We also report on perceived user demand, effort and performance.",

Although attempts were undertaken to enhance fidget devices with advanced technology, such as sensors and displays, no works exist that explored fidgeting with actuated devices. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of programmable actuated fidgeting and the design space for SwarmFidget. Programmable actuated fidgeting is a type of fidgeting that involves devices integrated with actuators, sensors, and computing to enable a dynamic and customizable interactive fidgeting experience. SwarmFidget is an instance of a platform where tabletop swarm robots are used to facilitate programmable actuated fidgeting. To engage with actuated fidgets, users can input commands through various modalities such as touch or gesture, and the actuators in the fidgeting device will respond in a programmable manner to provide haptic, visual, or audio feedback.",

The haptic feedback from such passive objects can be customized by changing their shape and structure but cannot be changed dynamically. Therefore, we propose a simple TUI that can provide dynamic haptic feedback on a touch device. We use an electromagnet embedded in the tangible object and a magnetic sheet fixed on the back of a touch device. An electric current flowing through the electromagnet and the customizable magnetic pattern printed on the magnetic sheet together produce magnetic interference. The magnetic interference caused by these magnetic objects is actively generated during interaction with the touch device to provide dynamic haptic feedback of both bumps and vibrations. ",

      "abstract": "We present AirTied, a device that fabricates truss structures in a fully automatic fashion. AirTied achieves this by unrolling a 20cm-wide inflatable plastic tube and tying nodes into it. AirTied creates nodes by holding onto a segment of tube, stacking additional tube segments on top of it, tying them up, and releasing the result. The resulting structures are material-efficient and light as well as sturdy, as we demonstrate by creating a 6m-tower. Unlike the prior art, AirTied requires no scaffolding and no building blocks, bringing automated truss construction into the reach of personal fabrication.",

However, current methods tend to apply edits to models globally, which risks compromising the intended functionality of the 3D model when fabricated in the physical world. For example, modifying functional segments in 3D models, such as the base of a vase, could break the original functionality of the model, thus causing the vase to fall over. We introduce Style2Fab, a system for automatically segmenting 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements, and selectively modifying the aesthetic segments, without affecting the functional segments. Style2Fab uses a semi-automatic classification method to decompose 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements, and differentiable rendering to selectively stylize the functional segments. We demonstrate the functionality of this tool with six application examples across domains of Home Interior Design, Medical Applications, and Personal Accessories.",

However, these tools could not provide a coherent context for any target words of learners’ interests, and they seldom help practice word usage. In this paper, we work with teachers and students to iteratively develop Storyfier, which leverages text generation models to enable learners to read a generated story that covers any target words, conduct a story cloze test, and use these words to write a new story with adaptive AI assistance. Our within-subjects study (N=28) shows that learners generally favor the generated stories for connecting target words and writing assistance for easing their learning workload. However, in the read-cloze-write learning sessions, participants using Storyfier perform worse in recalling and using target words than learning with a baseline tool without our AI features. We discuss insights into supporting learning tasks with generative models.",

      "abstract": "The recent advent of large language models (LLM) has resulted in high-performing conversational agents such as ChatGPT. These agents must remember key information from an ongoing conversation to provide responses that are contextually relevant to the user. However, these agents have limited memory and can be distracted by irrelevant parts of the conversation. While many strategies exist to manage conversational memory, users currently lack affordances for viewing and controlling what the agent remembers, resulting in a poor mental model and conversational breakdowns. In this paper, we present Memory Sandbox, an interactive system and design probe that allows users to manage the conversational memory of LLM-powered agents. By treating memories as data objects that can be viewed, manipulated, recorded, summarized, and shared across conversations, Memory Sandbox provides interaction affordances for users to manage how the agent should `see' the conversation.",

In this demonstration, we introduce such a surface (a \"robotic wall\"), which is able to begin in a neutral state, assume a desired functional shape, and later return to its neutral state. The surface can then assume a completely different functional shape, all under program control.\r\n\r\nOur surface is designed for large-scale applications, but still uses small, power-efficient actuators to reconfigure itself dynamically. Instead of driving the shape change at many points (i.e. at each hinge of our structure), we use lightweight motors to constrain its shape, and relocate the transformative actuation force to the outer edges of our surface.",

      "abstract": "PCB debugging can be tricky. For example, if we want to use an oscilloscope to measure signals of interest in the PCB, we need to locate them in the schematic and select the appropriate pad for each signal on the PCB layout on which to put the oscilloscope probes. This process hence requires frequent switching between the schematics and the PCB layouts. Moreover, our hands may not be precise and stable enough to accurately place the probes on the pads without causing short circuits with adjacent pins, which can lead to further issues. Additionally, if multiple signals need to be tested, two hands will not be enough. Probe hook clips can be used, but this often necessitates the use of extension wires that must be soldered onto the targeted pads. To streamline the debugging process, we introduce the PCBPT (PCB Probing Tester). This innovative solution seamlessly bridges from schematic to test equipment by using a robotic probe and actuated board holder. By selecting signals of interest directly from a GUI, users can instantly monitor the output on an oscilloscope, significantly improving the effectiveness of the debugging process.",

However, in conventional 3D printing techniques, the hair structure is printed using a uniform and general plastic such as Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA). In this study, we attempt to print the hair structure using conductive and magnetic iron filaments, commonly used to allow an Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printer to create a functional object, to extend the possibility of the 3D printed hair technique. Furthermore, we planted the printed hair in the soft resin used for resin crafts. We provide detailed material information and validate the printability of each filament. With these methods, we demonstrate applications, such as hairy devices that can detect when a human touches hair, brushes attracted by magnet arrays, and flexible attachment of hair structures to the human body.",

However, LLMs like ChatGPT present significant limitations in supporting complex information tasks due to the insufficient affordances of the text-based medium and linear conversational structure. Through a formative study with ten participants, we found that LLM interfaces often present long-winded responses, making it difficult for people to quickly comprehend and interact flexibly with various pieces of information, particularly during more complex tasks. We present Graphologue, an interactive system that converts text-based responses from LLMs into graphical diagrams to facilitate information-seeking and question-answering tasks. Graphologue employs novel prompting strategies and interface designs to extract entities and relationships from LLM responses and constructs node-link diagrams in real-time. Further, users can interact with the diagrams to flexibly adjust the graphical presentation and to submit context-specific prompts to obtain more information. Utilizing diagrams, Graphologue enables graphical, non-linear dialogues between humans and LLMs, facilitating information exploration, organization, and comprehension.",

      "abstract": "Prior research has explored modifying taste through electrical stimulation. While promising, such interfaces often only elicit taste changes while in contact with the user’s tongue (e.g., cutlery with electrodes), making them incompatible with eating and swallowing real foods. Moreover, most interfaces cannot selectively alter basic tastes, but only the entire flavor profile (e.g., cannot selectively alter bitterness). To tackle this, we propose taste retargeting, a method of altering taste perception by delivering chemical modulators to the mouth before eating. These modulators temporarily change the response of taste receptors to foods, selectively suppressing or altering basic tastes. Our first study identified six accessible taste modulators that suppress salty, umami, sweet, or bitter and transform sour into sweet. Using these findings, we demonstrated an interactive application of this technique with the example of virtual reality, which we validated in our second study. We found that taste retargeting reduced the flavor mismatch between a food prop and other virtual foods.",

Visual Captions leverages a fine-tuned large language model to proactively suggest visuals that are relevant to the context of the ongoing conversation. We implemented Visual Captions as a user-customizable Chrome plugin with three levels of AI proactivity: Auto-display (AI autonomously adds visuals), Auto-suggest (AI proactively recommends visuals), and On-demand-suggest (AI suggests visuals when prompted). We showcase the usage of Visual Captions in open-vocabulary settings, and how the addition of visuals based on the context of conversations could improve comprehension of complex or unfamiliar concepts. In addition, we demonstrate three approaches people can interact with the system with different levels of AI proactivity. Visual Captions is open-sourced at https://github.com/google/archat.",

Our system utilizes dance challenge videos as the information source, performing music analysis and pose estimation to segment the dance into learnable chunks and generate a practice plan that implements motor learning techniques such as incremental part-learning and fading guidance. These plans are presented in a web app that implements video demonstration, augmented webcam mirroring, practice recording/review functionality, and both concurrent and terminal feedback. By operating on a ubiquitous information source, generating the  lessons automatically, and requiring only a web browser and webcam in the user interface, our system is a step towards significantly expanding the reach of dance choreography learning and a platform for further research into dance HCI.",

      "abstract": "Specifying designs for additive manufacturing using machine toolpaths unlocks design attributes such as surface textures and shapes determined by material and machine constrains compared to higher level representations like 3D geometries. Current methodologies for authoring these designs necessitate a high level of programming or geometric understanding, posing a significant barrier to entry and limited control. Additionally, the confinement of these workflows within computer screens obscures the comprehension of material and dimensional constraints. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the  direct manipulation of machine toolpaths in Augmented Reality for clay 3D printing. Our application relies on hand interactions to edit path control points. We also provide a set of options that allow the user to control how their changes to one control points are broadcast to others to determine surface shapes and textures.  By leveraging AR interactions in a physical context, our proposal aims to leverage existing physical workflows and enable practitioners to apply their understanding of material properties and visual understanding of physical 3D objects.",

      "abstract": "Recent Generative AI models have been shown to be substantially useful in different fields, often bridging modal gaps, such as text-prompted image or human motion generation. However, their accompanying interfaces do not sufficiently support iteration and interaction between models, and due to the computational intensity of generative technology, can be unforgiving to user errors and missteps. We propose DeckFlow, a no-code interface for multimodal generative workflows which encourages rapid iteration and experimentation between disparate models. \\system emphasizes the persistence of output, the maintenance of generation settings and dependencies, and continual steering through user-defined concept groups. Taking design cues from Card Games and Affinity Diagrams, DeckFlow is aimed to lower the barrier for non-experts to explore and interact with generative AI.",

The device aims to overcome the limitations of existing cutaneous feedback devices, which often provide a restricted range of sensations and are primarily tested on simple synthetic surfaces. HUGO was meticulously designed through a human-centered process to enable users to experience realistic touch sensations encountered in various real-world scenarios. HUGO utilizes a parallel manipulator and a pin-array mechanism that operate concurrently at a frequency of up to 200Hz to simulate both coarse and fine geometrical features. By employing a high operation frequency and decomposing the tactile feedback into distinct features, HUGO enables a more accurate replication of tactile experiences associated with different surfaces. The demonstration will showcase HUGO’s capabilities in providing authentic haptic feedback. This includes facilitating social interactions, enhancing e-commerce experiences, and improving gaming interactions through realistic haptic engagement with real-world surfaces. ",

Our materials consist of many cells that transmit signals using an embedded bistable spring. When triggered, the bistable spring displaces and triggers the next cell. We integrate a recharging mechanism to recharge the bistable springs, enabling multiple computation rounds. Between the iterations, we enable reprogramming the logic functions after fabrication. We demonstrate that such materials can trigger a simple controlled actuation anywhere in the material to change the local shape, texture, stiffness, and display. This enables large-scale interactive and functional materials with no or a small number of external actuators. We showcase the capabilities of our system with various examples: a haptic floor with tunable stiffness for different VR scenarios, a display with easy-to-reconfigure messages after fabrication, or a tactile notification integrated into users’ desktops.",

Our ChromaNails reprogrammer uses a miniature RGB projector and a UV light source to project different wavelengths of light onto our photochromic nail polish. We create this nail polish by mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY) photochromic dye into a base substrate polish. This enables us to control the saturation and desaturation of the CMY particles inside our nail polish to various colors inside the CMY color space. Our integrated user interface enables laypeople to select their preferred color texture and adapts to various nail shapes. We demonstrate the usefulness of ChromaNails for on-body interaction through four application examples on reprogrammable fingernail QR codes, on-body calendars, security, and fashion.\r\n",

      "abstract": "For grasping, tactile stimuli to multiple fingertips are crucial for realistic shape rendering and precise manipulation. Pinching is particularly important in virtual reality since it is frequently used to grasp virtual objects. However, the interaction space of tactile feedback around pinching is underexplored due to a lack of means to provide co-located but different stimulation to finger pads. We propose a double-sided electrotactile device with a thin and flexible form factor to fit within pinched fingerpads. The device comprises two overlapping 3 × 3 electrode arrays to enable single-sided, simultaneous double-sided, and spatiotemporal double-sided electrotactile stimulation. Through two user studies, we (1) demonstrate that participants can accurately discriminate between single-sided and double-sided stimulation and find a qualitative difference in tactile sensation; and (2) confirm the occurrence of apparent tactile motion between fingers and present optimal parameters for continuous or discrete movements. In five VR applications, we demonstrate how double-sided tactile interactions can produce spatiotemporal movement of a virtual object between fingers and enrich touch feedback for UI operation.",

However, as these generative models are non-deterministic and black box, end-users are faced with a new task: configuring generation pipelines (e.g., modifying inputs and parameters) until results are tailored to their needs. In this work, we present \"cells, generators, and lenses\", a framework for designing interfaces that support interactive objects that embody the components of generation pipelines (i.e., input, model, output). By applying our framework, designers can create interfaces that allow end-users to create multiple versions of these objects, compose them into pipelines, and mix-and-match pipelines to efficiently iterate and experiment on diverse configurations. Applying our framework, we redesigned three different writing systems—story writing, copywriting, and email composing—and conducted a user study (N=18) to showcase how cells, generators, and lenses encouraged users to test more, generate more, and make more use of generated outputs.",

However, inside a discarded device (from consumer devices to one’s own prototypes), an electronics designer could find dozens to thousands of reusable components, including microcontrollers, sensors, voltage regulators, etc. Despite this, existing electronic design tools assume users will buy all components anew. To tackle this, we propose ecoEDA, an interactive tool that enables electronics designers to explore recycling electronic components during the design process. We accomplish this via (1) creating suggestions to assist users in identifying and designing with recycled components; and (2) maintaining a library of useful data relevant to reuse (e.g., allowing users to find which devices contain which components). Through example use-cases, we demonstrate how our tool can enable various pathways to recycling e-waste. To evaluate it, we conducted a user study where participants used our tool to create an electronic schematic with components from torn-down e-waste devices. We found that participants’ designs made with ecoEDA featured an average of 66% of recycled components. Last, we reflect on challenges and opportunities for building software that promotes e-waste reuse.",

      "abstract": "Touchscreen devices, designed with an assumed range of user abilities and interaction patterns, often present challenges for individuals with diverse abilities to operate independently. Prior efforts to improve accessibility through tools or algorithms necessitated alterations to touchscreen hardware or software, making them inapplicable for the large number of existing legacy devices. In this paper, we introduce BrushLens, a hardware interaction proxy that performs physical interactions on behalf of users while allowing them to continue utilizing accessible interfaces, such as screenreaders and assistive touch on smartphones, for interface exploration and command input. BrushLens maintains an interface model for accurate target localization and utilizes exchangeable actuators for physical actuation across a variety of device types, effectively reducing user workload and minimizing the risk of mistouch. Our evaluations reveal that BrushLens lowers the mistouch rate and empowers visually and motor impaired users to interact with otherwise inaccessible physical touchscreens more effectively.",

By employing an infrared-fluorescent filament that emits light at a wavelength higher than the incident light, our optical detection setup filters out all the noise to only have the markers present in the infrared camera image. The high contrast of the markers allows us to robustly track them when objects are in motion.\r\n\r\nWe also demonstrate a software interface for automatically embedding these markers for the input object geometry, and a hardware module with a high-speed camera that can be attached to existing AR/VR headsets. We developed an image processing pipeline to robustly localize the markers in real time from the captured images. We illustrate applications for fabricating wearables for motion capture, tangible interfaces for AR/VR, and enabling rapid product tracking, as well as privacy-preserving night vision.",

      "abstract": "The ability to track a user’s arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortu- nately, this capability is not readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry privacy issues, or utilize mul- tiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a median positional error of 11.0 cm, without the user having to provide training data.",

      "abstract": "Living bio-materials are increasingly used in HCI for fabricating objects by growing. However, how to integrate electronics to make these objects interactive still needs to be clarified. This paper presents an exploration of the fabrication design space of Biohybrid Interactive Devices, a class of interactive devices fabricated by merging electronic components and living organisms. From the exploration of this space using bacterial cellulose, we outline a fabrication framework centered on the biomaterials‘ life cycle phases. We introduce a set of novel fabrication techniques for embedding conductive elements, sensors, and output components through biological (e.g. bio-fabrication and bio-assembling) and digital processes. We demonstrate the combinatory aspect of the framework by realizing three tangible, wearable, and shape-changing interfaces. Finally, we discuss the sustainability of our approach, its limitations, and the implications for bio-hybrid systems in HCI.",

      "abstract": "Virtual and augmented reality headsets are making significant progress in audio-visual immersion and consumer adoption. However, their haptic immersion remains low, due in part to the limitations of vibrotactile actuators which dominate the AR/VR market. In this work, we present a new approach to create high-resolution shape-changing fingerpad arrays with 20 haptic pixels/cm^2. Unlike prior pneumatic approaches, our actuators are low-profile (5mm thick), low-power (approximately 10mW/pixel), and entirely self-contained, with no tubing or wires running to external infrastructure. We show how multiple actuator arrays can be built into a five-finger, 160-actuator haptic glove that is untethered, lightweight (207g, including all drive electronics and battery), and has the potential to reach consumer price points at volume production. We describe the results from a technical performance evaluation and a suite of eight user studies, quantifying the diverse capabilities of our system. This includes recognition of object properties such as complex contact geometry, texture, and compliance, as well as expressive spatiotemporal effects.",

However, their usefulness is constrained by being unable to distinguish between multiple speakers, track which direction speech is coming from, and provide acceptable performance in noisy environments. \r\n\r\nThis work introduces efficient real-time audio localization and adaptive beamforming algorithms on custom sound perception hardware running on a low-power microcontroller and four integrated microphones. A prototype is implemented in a  phone case form factor and is plug-and-play with modern smartphones. \r\n    \r\nWe characterize the performance in technical evaluations of localization, beamforming, and diarization. We demonstrate how the phone case extends existing smartphones with speaker diarization in a speech-to-text app, sound direction visualization, and sound enhancement through beamforming. In the future, we hope our approach will inspire the widespread adoption of advanced microphone arrays that natively unlock the potential of spatial sound processing and perception in mobile and wearable devices.",

      "abstract": "Blind and low vision (BLV) creators use images to communicate with sighted audiences. However, creating or retrieving images is challenging for BLV creators as it is difficult to use authoring tools or assess image search results. Thus, creators limit the types of images they create or recruit sighted collaborators. While text-to-image generation models let creators generate high-fidelity images based on a text description (i.e. prompt), it is difficult to assess the content and quality of generated images. We present GenAssist, a system to make text-to-image generation accessible. Using our interface, creators can verify whether generated image candidates followed the prompt, access additional details in the image not specified in the prompt, and skim a summary of similarities and differences between image candidates. To power the interface, GenAssist uses a large language model to generate visual questions, vision-language models to extract answers, and a large language model to summarize the results. Our study with 12 BLV creators demonstrated that GenAssist enables and simplifies the process of image selection and generation, making visual authoring more accessible to all.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces HoloBots, a mixed reality interface that augments holographic telepresence with a synchronized actuated tangible user interface. Beyond existing mixed reality telepresence, HoloBots lets remote users not only be visually and spatially present, but also enables them to \\textit{physically} engage with the local users and their environment, allowing them to touch, grasp, manipulate, and interact with remote physical objects as if they were co-located in the same shared space. We achieve this by synchronizing holographic user motion (Hololens 2 and Azure Kinect) with tabletop mobile robots (Sony Toio), which enables scalable, deployable, and generalizable tangible remote collaboration. HoloBots allows various interactions, such as object actuation, virtual hand physicalization, world-in-miniature exploration, shared tangible interfaces, embodied guidance, and haptic communication. We evaluate our system by comparing it with hologram-only and robot-only conditions. Both quantitative and qualitative results with 12 participants confirm that our system significantly enhances the level of co-presence and shared experience of mixed reality remote collaboration, compared to the other conditions.",

The system is completely electronic-free, incorporating customized energy harvesting pumps, storage units with variable volume-pressure characteristics, and tailored valves that operate autonomously. Additionally, the paper provides a design tool to guide the development of the system and includes several environmental applications to showcase its capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Existing text selection techniques on touchscreen focus on improving the control for moving the carets. Coarse-grained text selection on word- and phrase- levels have not received much support beyond word-snapping and entity recognition. We introduce 1D-Touch, a novel text selection method that complements the carets-based sub-word selection by facilitating the selection of words and larger semantic units. This method employs a simple vertical slide gesture to expand and contract a selection area from a word. The expansion can be by words or by semantic chunks ranging from sub-phrases to sentences, as implemented in two variants of our technique named WordTouch and ChunkTouch. This approach shifts the concept of text selection, away from defining a range by locating the first and last characters, towards a dynamic process of expanding and contracting a textual entity. While the full paper (expected to appear at the ACM ISS 2023) details the evaluation, this demonstration showcases 1D-Touch with a few applications of coarse-grained text selection, to engage the audience in discussions about its effectiveness and applications, as well as its integration with existing character-level selection techniques.",

Projectoroid converts its real-world position and orientation calculated by its internal sensors into the position and orientation of a camera in virtual space. Consequently, it can project the image captured within the virtual space onto the real-world floor. Thus, Projectoroid is capable of revealing a segment of an expansive virtual space into the real world based on its position and orientation. In this paper, we refer to the degree to which people recognize the correspondence between the virtual space and the real world from the projected image as the \"sense of reveal.\"We believe that an increase in the sense of reveal would heighten people's interest in the content from the virtual world. The results of our user study show that the sense of reveal is amplified as the outline of the projected image becomes more circular.",

      "abstract": "Efficient text entry is a crucial aspect of the user experience for augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMD). Eye-tracking for virtual keyboard interaction is a popular choice for AR text entry, as it is intuitive, privacy-preserving, and socially acceptable. However, as AR HMDs move toward more consumer-friendly form factors and price points, technical constraints necessitate trade-offs that result in a limited field of view (FoV) and reduced eye-tracking accuracy.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we develop EyeClick, a novel two-step eye-hand interaction method utilizing a modified QWERTY keyboard for AR HMDs. To type, users first employ gaze to select a large area containing multiple characters, then press a button on a handheld controller to choose a single character from the selected area. We demonstrated competitive speed and reduced corrected error rate (CER) with two variants of the EyeClick design: ColType (7.30 WPM) and RowType (9.41 WPM). \r\n\r\nWe also integrated ChatGPT with the EyeClick keyboard to build an interactive information retrieval AR application. We demonstrate that the EyeClick keyboard can help users efficiently extract information about surroundings by typing to ChatGPT in mixed reality.",

The traditional ways to develop critical paper reading (CPR) skills, e.g., checking general tutorials or taking reading courses, often can not provide individuals with adaptive and accessible support. In this paper, we first derive user requirements of a CPR training tool based on literature and a survey study (N=52). Then, we develop \\name{}, an interactive tool for CPR training. It leverages text summarization techniques to train readers’ skills in grasping the paper’s main ideas. It further utilizes template-based generated questions to help them learn how to raise critical thoughts. A mixed-design study (N=24) shows that compared to a baseline tool with general CPR guidance, students trained by \\name{} perform better in independently raising critical thinking questions on a new paper. We conclude with design considerations for CPR training tools.",

However, human feedback is not always readily available. Given the recent emergence of LLMs, which have been shown to be proficient in rule-based reasoning, we explore the potential of LLMs to provide feedback automatically. In particular, we investigate automating heuristic evaluation, which currently entails a human expert assessing how well a UI adheres to a given set of design guidelines. We build an LLM-based heuristic  evaluation plugin for Figma, which designers can use to evaluate their UI mockups. The plugin queries the LLM with the guidelines and a JSON representation of the UI mockup and then renders the identified guideline violations as constructive suggestions for design improvements. Future work is needed to study what types of usability problems can be successfully identified by LLM-driven heuristic evaluation.",

However, sounds often overlap and conflict in priorities, which makes them hard to perceive and differentiate. This is exacerbated in mixed-reality settings, where real-world and virtual sounds can conflict with each other. This may exacerbate the awareness of mixed reality for blind people who heavily rely on audio information in their everyday life. To address this, we present a sound rendering framework SoundBlender, consisting of six sound manipulators for users to better organize and manipulate real and virtual sounds across time and space: Ambience Builder, Feature Shifter, Earcon Generator, Prioritizer, Spatializer, and Stylizer. We demonstrate how the sound manipulators can increase mixed-reality awareness through a simulated working environment, and a meeting application.",

We propose AI-augmented coaching through SketchSearch, allowing experts to create exercises with automated feedback in surgery videos for self-learning. Surgeons often seek specific scenes for teaching, relying on visual cues. SketchSearch simplifies this through a three-step process: key frame extraction, template reference maps creation via image segmentation, and fine-tuning for frame retrieval.",

To this end, we propose ZINify, the first approach to automatically transform research papers into engaging zines using large language models (LLM) and text-to-image generators. Following zine's long history of supporting independent, creative expression, we propose a technique that can work with authors to build more engaging, marketable, and unconventional content that is based on their research. We believe that our work will help make research more engaging and accessible to all while helping papers stand out in crowded online venues.\r\n",

      "abstract": "Since the advent of computer interfaces, significant strides have been made toward providing high-fidelity visual, auditory, and haptic experiences. However, stimulating the senses of smell, taste, and temperature has sorely stagnated over the last century, primarily due to the field’s dependence on adapted methods from mechanical and robotic engineering. I posit that novel interfacing techniques are necessary to engage the human senses fully. My research explores the integration of these underutilized yet crucial senses by investigating a new class of devices termed “chemical interfaces.” These devices manipulate the human senses by interfacing with our perceptions’ biochemical cascades through carefully selected chemicals. Unlike conventional approaches originating from robotics or mechanical engineering, chemical interfaces provide distinctive affordances. My research illustrates several such affordances, including reduced power consumption for thermal feedback, miniaturized versatile mechanisms for haptics, and new interactions for taste via chemical selectivity. My approach lays a promising foundation for incorporating these rich senses into our digital interactions and, maybe in the future, influencing how we engage with our food and the air we breathe in our everyday life.",

The proposed system recognizes each frame of an unfinished manga drawn by a user and proposes successive frames, considering the content recognized till then, e.g., the storyline, frame composition, and punchline. The system updates the proposal as the manga drawing proceeds. The proposed system comprises four modules for 1) recognizing the user’s drawings, 2) generating four sentences that describe the storyline, 3) generating images, each of which corresponds to a manga frame from the above sentences, and 4) choosing the user-preferred manga candidate from a number of potential choices. The proposed system does not require AI to generate the 4-frame manga; instead, the user draws the 4-frame manga with the help of the system. In other words, the user decides whether to accept or reject the AI’s proposal.",

However, prior research has yet to provide expressive agency for makers doing this work, which includes rapid experimentation, safe adjustments and detailed, accurate control of machines and data. To address this, I frame exploratory fabrication as physical-digital programming: handling physical contingencies within core features of a programming language. I posit that physical-digital programming will let exploratory makers build digital fabrication workflows that are otherwise prohibitively difficult to construct, share, and improve. To test this hypothesis, I built three systems that prototype components of physical-digital programming: a common, multimodal programming environment; a formal grammar of machine functionality; and a method of generating task-specific visualizations of machine behavior. In addition, I am working on a fourth system intended to synchronize code assumptions with physical-world states through user-defined axioms and augmented reality. These tools will help both novice and experienced makers use programming to solve emerging problems that require physical automation.",

      "abstract": "Constraints are fundamental to human-centered design. Although by definition, constraints \"limit\" or \"restrict\" the capability of software, when designed correctly, they can have enabling characteristics as well. In my dissertation, I seek to understand how user interface constraints can influence user behaviour when reading and writing text. First, I discuss a document reader with auto-scrolling to facilitate time-bounded reading for increased focus. Second, I contribute the idea of limiting how much text can be highlighted in a document to encourage readers to think more about what is truly important in the document. Lastly, I discuss how constraining an AI writing assistant through prompts with varying levels of detail may improve a writer's feelings of ownership. Through these three projects, my dissertation will contribute novel constraints-based interaction techniques that can be integrated into new or existing systems, which is of interest to the UIST community and the HCI community more broadly.",

      "abstract": "The new generation of generative AI models offers interactive opportunities that may fulfill long-standing aspirations in human-computer interaction and open doors to new forms of interaction that we have yet to imagine. The UIST community has a unique vantage point that can lead to critical contributions in envisioning a future of interactive computing that appropriately leverages the power of these new generative AI models. However, we are only just beginning to understand the research area that exists at the intersection of interaction and generative AI. By bringing together members of the UIST community interested in this intersection, we seek to initiate discussions on the potential of generative AI in architecting new forms of interactions. Key topics of interest include the exploration of novel categories of interactions made possible by generative AI, the development of methods for enabling more powerful and direct user control of generative AI, and the identification of model and architecture requirements for generative AI in interaction literature. The workshop will foster community building and produce concrete deliverables, including a research agenda, model/architecture requirements, and a simulated debate generated by a generative agent architecture.",

Designed as an affordable communication solution for those with communication challenges, Aisen facilitates expression through a unique word-selection interface. Rather than using a traditional keyboard, Aisen introduces a two-tiered \"word card\" system. This system includes a static set of cards tailored to the patient's specific needs and a \"dynamic\" set where cards are intelligently generated by LLMs based on user input and preferences. Our research delineated three specific user personas, emphasizing Aisen's applicability for elderly patients. The platform integrates an eye-tracking mechanism, a gaze-responsive interface, and a word card repository enriched with LLMs. This endeavor highlights the transformative potential of web-enabled eye-tracking and LLMs in enhancing communication for individuals with impairments.",

Capturing, modeling, and augmenting these physical interactions are crucial for enhancing human well-being and promoting intelligent system designs. However, the pervasive and diverse nature of these interactions poses challenges that require scalable and adaptable systems. To address these challenges, I adopt an integrated approach that combines digital fabrication and machine learning techniques. The approach involves developing a digital design and fabrication pipeline to integrate sensing and actuation capabilities into textile-based platforms, and capturing diverse datasets on human-environment interactions to enable intelligent and adaptive applications. The dissertation showcases past and ongoing works on intelligent textile-based sensing and actuating platforms that embody this approach, including tactile sensing garments, an intelligent carpet for human pose estimation, programmable textile-based actuators for assistive wearables, and smart gloves for adaptive tactile interaction transfer. Moving forward, I aim to explore applications of the developed systems in healthcare, robotics, and human behaviors intervention, and expand to diverse sensing and actuation modalities.",

      "abstract": "As sustainability becomes an increasingly pressing concern across disciplines, the design and fabrication communities within HCI are rapidly discovering and sharing a wealth of novel materials, tools, and workflows, allowing us to make physical artifacts that are more eco-friendly than ever before. Still, sustainability and functionality are often at odds with one another when it comes to the design of interactive systems, with most systems still relying on conventional electronic components that must be extracted and individually handled at end of life. My work offers approaches for designing decomposable interactive systems that are made with materials that are widely available, safe, and even edible, empowering the ``everyday designer'' to make sustainable systems for applications that do not demand long operation times or high power. Enabled by the growing ecosystem of decomposable materials and systems, I also propose new opportunities for designing for unmaking, a counterpart to making that opens the opaque, industrial processes of recycling and composting as rich design spaces to encourage further engagement and critical reflection around themes of sustainability, materiality, and consumption.",

      "abstract": "Pervasive symptoms in autistic individuals, such as facing more frequent challenges in social situations, pose significant obstacles in their pursuit of an independent life in adulthood. Although much research has proposed computer-assisted programs (e.g., smartphone apps and VR-based systems), there is a significant lack of systems designed for autistic adults and their independence, and the preferences or characteristics of autistic individuals are not carefully reflected in the design process. Thus, in my dissertation, I focus on two requirements of autistic adults for supporting their independence: (1) an independent and healthy lifestyle and (2) positive social skills practice. These requirements were externalized in two gamified mobile apps (PuzzleWalk and RoutineAid) and two VR-based systems (VISTA and V-DAT). My research aims to design and develop mobile/VR systems and derive design guidelines to support the independence of autistic adults.",

      "abstract": "Manual crafts typically involve action-oriented workflows, wherein the craftsperson performs a series of repeated actions to create beautiful intricate artifacts. Despite working with similar materials, digital fabrication workflows often implement methods that differ fundamentally from manual ones. In my dissertation work, I aim to develop action-oriented digital fabrication systems that implement abstractions derived from craft domain-expert knowledge. I theorize that action-oriented systems have the potential to (1) support the integration of computational tools with manual practices, (2) enable complex design tasks that would be challenging to achieve through other means, and  (3) leverage the unique properties of materials through fine control over machine toolpath. To investigate this theory, I developed three digital fabrication systems, which I evaluated by producing various artifacts. Additionally, I propose analyzing my work and HCI system research in general through the lenses of three theoretical frameworks that reflect on materiality, i.e. new materialism, indigenous epistemologies, and post-colonial theory on skill mastery. I believe this analysis can offer alternative perspectives that promote a more inclusive understanding of the relationship between humans, materials, and technology in the context of digital fabrication.",

While researchers have begun exploring the haptic characteristics of EAMs, their integration into Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) shows challenges, including limited commercial availability and a lack of interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. This workshop specifically focuses on electrostatic (ES), soft electrohydraulic (SEH), and electroosmotic (EO) actuators. By bringing together researchers in the field, we aim to facilitate the exchange of findings, techniques, fabrication practices, and tacit knowledge within the HCI community. The workshop combines interactive demos, focused discussions, and hands-on ideation, providing a platform to explore the haptic potential of EAMs, identify key challenges and opportunities, and envision how these programmable materials can unlock new haptic interactions and interfaces.",

ScentCarving consists of four layers, including the (1) paper-based substrate, (2) odor layer containing the ink-based aroma, (3) odor-sealing layer by introducing a thermoplastic material, and (4) a heating module using conductive cooper to soften the sealing layer and release the scent. ScentCarving also involves an easy-to-access Odor Printing technique capable of engraving fragrances onto thin and flexible substrates. We conducted a small-scale user study to test the scent-releasing behavior in terms of smell distance and responsive time.",

With a wearable scent-delivery device, a set of gestures that interact with virtual objects are mapped to corresponding olfactory tasks, i.e., scent release, scent intensity adjustment, and scent switch. We conducted a user study for preliminary validation, revealing significant advantages of gestural interactions over the traditional handle controller for scent release. Our findings demonstrate the potential of gestural interactions in enhancing proactive smell experiences in VR and contribute insights into how proactive gestural input can benefit engaging olfactory experiences in virtual environments.",

However, this is a challenging task with external cameras and sensors due to user movement, self-occlusions and diversity of data streams during task performance. In this work, we present ModBand, a wearable sensor headband with an accompanying software pipeline to collect and visualize data such as facial images, pupillometry, egocentric video, and heart rate during physical task performance. ModBand can be modified, extended, and used both as a standalone device or integrated with existing head-mounted AR devices for AI-based task guidance. Our modular design incorporates cost-effective fabrication methods, such as 3D printing, and enables convenient integration or exclusion of sensors to support custom data collection needs.",

The system represents the dependencies between learning objects using a directed graph, and utilizes a binary questionnaire interface to continuously determine and update the user's learning topics and knowledge status. This system enables users to clearly understand where they are in their learning process and what they should learn next, thereby improving learning efficiency, motivation, and self-efficiency. We conducted an experiment involving 9 participants, and our results implied that the proposed system is beneficial for beginners, particularly in reducing learners' cognitive load and enhancing their motivation and self-efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) is a critical to effectively leverage their capabilities. However, due to the inherent stochastic and opaque nature of LLMs, prompt engineering is far from an exact science. Crafting prompts that elicit the desired responses still requires a lot of trial and error to gain a nuanced understanding of a model's strengths and limitations for one's specific task context and target application. To support users in sensemaking around the outputs of LLMs, we create ChainForge, an open-source visual programming environment for prompt engineering. ChainForge is publicly available, both on the web (https://chainforge.ai) and as a locally installable Python package hosted on PyPI. We detail some features of ChainForge and how we iterated the design in response to internal and external feedback.",

We measured and reproduced the taste of garlic using a combination of odorless substances. We also developed a fork integrated with a mechanism for releasing the aroma of allicin to provide controlled exposure to the nose for a complete eating experience. Through our experiments, we successfully achieved identical taste and smell experiences, effectively eliminating the occurrence of bad breath. To validate our findings, participants tasted a dish of spaghetti and reported that the culinary experience was very similar to that of normal garlic-infused dishes, with no detectable bad breath.",

By realizing this phenomenon in edible materials, it is possible to create a new gastronomic experience that significantly changes the appearance of food. In this study, we propose a system that supports the workflow from the design to the fabrication of edible lenticular lenses. The proposed system consists of lenticular lens design software and fabrication hardware. Users can design a visual effect of lenticular lenses by software simulation and fabricate the lenses by the knife cutting method using the hardware of the proposed system. In this study, the fabricated lenses were compared with the rendered ones. Furthermore, we confirm that the fabrication of the lenses is highly accurate and requires a short time.",

However, the implementation of PI for large-scale programming lectures has proven challenging due to difficulties in monitoring student engagement, discussion topics, and code changes. This paper introduces VizPI, an interactive web tool that enables instructors to conduct, monitor, and assess PI for programming exercises in real-time. With features that visualize the progress of student discussions and code submissions, VizPI allows for more effective oversight of PI activities and the provision of personalized feedback at scale. Our work aims to transform the pedagogical approach to PI in programming education, making it more engaging and adaptable to student needs.",

Laseroma mainly consists of (1) a laser diode for rapidly generating the pointed heat, (2) a modular and replaceable odor strip which carries eleven miniature odor reservoirs, and (3) a stepper motor for rotating the odor strip for switching the target aroma.

      "abstract": "While online forums provide a convenient platform for people to interact anonymously with others who share similar interests, they have to deal with large amounts of hate speech and inappropriate content, often posted by users in the heat of the moment. This can have a negative impact on the psychological state of other forum users and moderators, who are tasked to identify and delete such content. We investigate a preventative approach to this problem with the design of EChat, a proof-of-concept augmentation to online forums that helps users attend to their emotional state. The user's current emotional state is detected using facial emotion recognition, and the aesthetics of the UI are adapted to reflect this emotion. In case of an emotion with negative valence such as anger or sadness, the UI aesthetic is gradually transitioned to one that evokes a more positive emotion. Semi-structured interviews with EChat users confirm the potential of emotion-aware design to reduce hateful content, and also highlight important design considerations.",

Current approaches simulate the 3D nature of the magnetic field and then visualize it in 2D images. However, limited 2D views hide much of the information in the complex spacecraft magnetic field. We describe a prototype system that allows for both an interactive 3D web experience as well as an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience to view and manipulate the 3D spacecraft magnetic field, allowing engineers and scientists to trace field lines, real-time in 3D. A preliminary user study validates the usefulness of the tool and guides further development.",

However, for some parents, actively engaging children in storytelling can be challenging. To address this, we introduce TaleMate—a platform designed to enhance shared reading by leveraging conversational agents that have been shown to support children’s engagement and learning. TaleMate enables a dynamic, participatory reading experience where parents and children can choose which characters they wish to embody. Moreover, the system navigates the challenges posed by digital reading tools, such as decreased parent-child interaction, and builds upon the benefits of traditional and digital reading techniques. TaleMate offers an innovative approach to fostering early reading habits, bridging the gap between traditional joint reading practices and the digital reading landscape.",

      "abstract": "Prior research has offered a plethora of wearables centred around sensing bodily actions ranging from more explicit data, such as movement and physiological response, to implicit information, such as ocular and brain activity. Bodily augmentations that physically extend the user's body along with altering body schema and image have been proposed recently as well, owing to factors such as accessibility and improving communication. However, these attempts have usually consisted of uncomfortable interfaces that either restrict the user's movement or are intrusive in nature. In this work, we present Pneunocchio, a playful nose augmentation based on the lore of Pinocchio. Pneunocchio consists of a pneumatic-based inflatable that a user wears on their nose to play a game of two truths and a lie. With our work, we aim to explore expressive bodily augmentations that respond to a player's physiological state that can alter the perception of their body while serving as an expressive match for a current part of the body.",

Yet, as visualizations grow more complex, they become less accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Traditional accessibility approaches like alternative text and data tables often fall short of capturing the full potential of data visualization. To bridge this gap, we introduce VizAbility, a novel multimodal accessible system that combines keyboard navigation with conventional interaction, enabling individuals with visual impairments to actively engage with and explore data visualizations. We built an LLM-based pipeline that classifies user queries and synthesizes underlying data, chart structure, user locality, and web-based information to answer the queries. Our preliminary evaluation using real-world questions from blind individuals demonstrates the significant potential of VizAbility.",

      "abstract": "Creating a diverse and comprehensive dataset of hand gestures for dynamic human-machine interfaces in the automotive domain can be challenging and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, we propose using synthetic hand gestures generated by virtual 3D models. In this paper, we present our open-source framework that utilizes Unreal Engine to synthesize realistic static and dynamic hand gestures, offering customization options and reducing the risk of overfitting. Multiple variants, including gesture speed, performance, and hand shape, are generated to improve generalizability. In addition, we simulate different camera locations and types, such as RGB, infrared, and depth cameras, without incurring additional time, effort, or cost to obtain these cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework, SynthoGestures, improves gesture recognition accuracy and can replace or augment real-hand datasets. By saving time and effort in the creation of a data set, our tool accelerates the development of gesture recognition systems for automotive and non-automotive applications.",

      "abstract": "Physiological measurement of player experience (PX) during gameplay has been of increasing interest within game research circles. A commonly-used non-invasive wearable device for physiological measurement is the Empatica E4 wristband, which offers multiple physiological metrics, ranging from electrodermal activity to heart rate. That said, the E4's integration with popular game engines such as Unity 3D presents certain challenges due to non-obvious critical bugs in the library and limited documentation applicability within the Unity context. In this paper, we present an open-source Unity plug-in designed to mitigate the challenges associated with integrating the E4 into Unity projects: E4UnityIntegration-MIT. The plug-in exposes the E4's API for interfacing with Unity C# scripts, thereby enabling realtime data collection and monitoring. E4UnityIntegration-MIT also provides the affordance of saving the E4 data into an external file for data analysis purposes. ",

However, body movements such as walking and arm motion, which are known to enhance creativity, are generally limited in web-based brainstorming. Thus, we propose “Augmented Post-it,” a novel augmented reality (AR) interaction system that enables body movements while brainstorming using a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT). With Augmented Post-it, ideas uttered by users are structured via GPT and extended into a spatial representation that encourages divergent thinking. This study contributes to future GPT-based AR brainstorming by extending the thinking ability of users in ways that engage their body movements to enhance creativity.",

The event camera, which captures intensity variations at high frequency, has been employed to this end. However, pupil tracking based only on events is difficult because events are sparse and limited. We propose high-speed pupil tracking using an event camera based on the bright and dark pupil effect. Two illumination sources generate events in the pupil area, and the pupil center is determined in real time at over 2000 Hz without requiring complete image from the events. We implemented gaze target estimation using smooth-pursuit eye movements and confirmed high-speed pupil tracking that may reduce the delay in gaze-based interaction.",

      "abstract": "This project explores the potential of Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) to represent and synthesize the timbre of five different notes of the Korean traditional musical instrument, Geomungo, using digital instrumental samples of the bass guitar, which has a similar mechanism to produce the sound. To evaluate the feasibility and quality of the digital recreation process, we compared hand-played Geomungo audio samples with digitally recreated audio samples using DDSP. The MFCC, spectral contrast, chroma features, and raw signal comparison, were used for assessment. Our findings show the possibility of applying DDSP to represent and synthesize the nuances of pitch and dynamics for expressive aspects of Geomungo's five different notes effectively. We also propose three audio features that can be used to evaluate the results quantitatively under the context of neural sound synthesis.",

We propose Ube: a trauma-informed sexual experience data donation app for online daters that is developed in collaboration with sexual violence experts and care practitioners.

However, the process is becoming increasingly complex amidst its development. We present Sacriface, a simple and versatile support structure for 3D printing which allows us to obtain further efficiency and flexibility in 3D printing. We simplified the strategy of expanding support structures taking advantage of a stable, growing overhang that gradually recovers its original shape as printing thickness increases. Sacriface is effortlessly designed and printable using an unmodified 3D printer, which enhances user customization.",

      "abstract": "We are at a transformational junction in computing, in the midst of an explosion in capabilities of foundational AI models that may soon match or exceed typical human abilities for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, a milestone often termed Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Achieving AGI (or even closely approaching it) will transform computing, with ramifications permeating through all aspects of society. This is a critical moment not only for Machine Learning research, but also for the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will define what I mean (and what I do NOT mean) by “AGI” (and related concepts, like superintelligence), and my journey from AGI skeptic to believing we are within five to ten years of reaching this milestone. I will then discuss how this new era of computing necessitates a new sociotechnical research agenda on methods and interfaces for studying and interacting with AGI. For instance, how can we extend status quo design and prototyping methods for envisioning novel experiences at the limits of our current imaginations? What novel interaction modalities might AGI (or superintelligence) enable (e.g., “ESP”)? How do we create interfaces for computing systems that may intentionally or unintentionally deceive an end-user? How do we bridge the “gulf of evaluation” when a system may arrive at an answer through methods that fundamentally differ from human mental models, or that may be too complex for an individual user to grasp? How do we evaluate technologies that may have unanticipated systemic side-effects on society when released into the wild?\r\n\r\nI will close by reflecting on the relationship between HCI and AI research. Typically, HCI and other sociotechnical domains are not considered as core to the ML research community as areas like model building. However, I argue that research on Human-AI Interaction and the societal impacts of AI is vital and central to this moment in computing history. HCI must not become a “second class citizen” to AI, but rather be recognized as fundamental to ensuring the path to AGI and beyond is a beneficial one.\r\n",

      "abstract": "As a traditional Chinese theatrical performance, the Peking Opera is a world intangible cultural heritage. However, appreciating and understanding the traditional arts of Peking Opera requires rich life experience and knowledge about traditional Chinese culture, which has led to its lack of recognition and support from younger Chinese audiences. To expand the audience for the traditional Chinese cultural heritage of Peking Opera and stimulate young people’s interest in learning about this art form, we introduce “OperAR” as an augmented reality game system that teaches children about the history and culture of the Peking Opera and how to perform Peking Opera using a cartoon virtual agent and a set of physical cards based on Peking Opera costumes. The pilot study results show the potential benefits of OperAR in enhancing children’s interactive experiences in virtual scenarios in addition to stimulating their interest in learning about Peking Opera.",

A robot’s ability to effectively deploy these behaviors can significantly enhance human-robot collaboration. We describe a simple zero-shot learning approach to generate facial expression and gaze shifting behaviors to control a social robot conversing with an individual or group. An initial prompt provides instructions to a pre-trained large language model on how the model can control a robot’s facial expression and eye gaze behaviors during a conversation. To demonstrate this, we describe a proof-of-concept implementation using the robot Furhat. This simple and easily customizable approach can be used to improve perception of a robot's social presence in multi-human-robot interactions.",

With new technologies, the reach of oral storytelling has expanded to allow remote listeners to tune in to radio programs and more recently to listen to podcasts and audio books, asynchronously. Digital tools offer easy-to-use applications that enable anyone the ability to not only narrate a story, but also to augment it in different ways, from adding sound effects in podcasts to narrating audio books with voice effects. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept system that allows oral storytellers to augment their storytelling with spatial sound effects. We present results from a preliminary study (n=12) that found the spatial sound effects to be vivid and immersive, indicating potential for semi-automated ways of augmenting oral storytelling. \r\n",

These systems employ technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning to simulate intelligent and human-like conversations. Driven by the personal experience of an individual with a neuromuscular disease who faces challenges with leaving home and contends with limited hand-motor control when operating digital systems, including conversational AI platforms, we propose a method aimed at enriching their interaction with conversational AI. Our prototype allows the creation of multiple agent personas based on hobbies and interests, to support topic-based conversations. In contrast with existing systems, such as Replika, that offer a 1:1 relation with a virtual agent, our design enables one-to-many relationships, easing the process of interaction for this individual by reducing the need for constant data input. We can imagine our prototype potentially helping others who are in a similar situation with reduced typing/input ability.",

Given a 3D model of the object and the structure of the cardboard to be reused, our system suggests the optimal net of a new box, which only requires minimum cuts and folds for fabrication by leveraging the edges of the input cardboard. To achieve this, we implemented a GUI visualizing the input models and the optimal net computed by our optimization algorithm. As a demonstration, we showed three design examples, with evaluation results of our method for reducing the length of cuts and folds.",

      "abstract": "To mitigate the risk of chronic diseases caused by prolonged sitting, sit-stand desks are promoted as an effective intervention to foster healthy behaviors among knowledge workers by allowing periodic posture switching between sitting and standing. However, conventional systems either let users manually switch the mode, and some research visited automated notification systems with pre-set time intervals. While this regular notification can promote healthy behaviors, such notification can act as external interruptions that hinder individuals' working productivity. Notably, knowledge workers are known to be reluctant to change their physical postures when concentrating. To address these issues, we propose considering work context based on their screen activities to encourage computer users to alternate their postures when it can minimize disruption, promoting healthy and productive behaviors. To that end, we are in the process of building a context-aware sit-stand desk that can promote healthy and productive behaviors. To that end, we have completed two modules: an application that monitors users' computer's ongoing activities and a sensor module that can measure the height of sit-stand desks for data collection. The collected data includes computer activities, measured desk height, and their willingness to switch to standing modes and will be used to build an LSTM prediction model to suggest optimal time points for posture changes, accompanied by appropriate desk height. In this work, we acknowledge previous relevant research, outline ongoing deployment efforts, and present our plan to validate the effectiveness of our approach via user studies.",

The system features an electric wheelchair and two motorized ramps with a fixed 10-degree angle, which the wheelchair can drive on and off to simulate ascending and descending in VR.

      "abstract": "Improving keystroke savings is a long-term goal of text input research. We present a study into the design space of an abbreviated style of text input called C-PAK (Correcting and completing variable-length Prefix-based Abbreviated Keystrokes) for text entry on mobile devices. Given a variable length and potentially inaccurate input string (e.g., 'li g t m'), C-PAK aims to expand it into a complete phrase (e.g., 'looks good to me'). We develop a C-PAK prototype keyboard, PhraseWriter, based on a current state-of-the-art mobile keyboard consisting of 1.3 million n-grams and 164,000 words. Using computational simulations on a large dataset of realistic input text, we found that, in comparison to conventional single-word suggestions, PhraseWriter improves the maximum keystroke savings rate by 6.7% (from 46.3% to 49.4,), reduces the word error rate by 14.7%, and is particularly advantageous for common phrases. We conducted a lab study of novice user behavior and performance which found that users could quickly utilize the C-PAK style abbreviations implemented in PhraseWriter, achieving a higher keystroke savings rate than forward suggestions (25% vs. 16%). Furthermore, they intuitively and successfully abbreviated more with common phrases. However, users had a lower overall text entry rate due to their limited experience with the system (28.5 words per minute vs. 37.7). We outline future technical directions to improve C-PAK over the PhraseWriter baseline, and further opportunities to study the perceptual, cognitive, and physical action trade-offs that underlie the learning curve of C-PAK systems.",

Before reading an article, Marvista helps a user plan what to read by filtering text based on how much time one can spend and what questions one is interested to find out from the article. During reading, Marvista helps the user reflect on their understanding of each paragraph with AI-generated questions. After reading, Marvista generates an explainable human-AI summary that combines both AI’s processing of the text, the user’s reading behavior, and user-generated data in the reading process. In contrast to prior work that offered (content-independent) interaction techniques or devices for reading, Marvista takes a human-AI collaborative approach that contributes text-specific guidance (content-aware) to support the entire reading process.",

      "abstract": "Story ideation is a critical part of the story-writing process. It is challenging to support computationally due to its exploratory and subjective nature. Tropes, which are recurring narrative elements across stories, are essential in stories as they shape the structure of narratives and our understanding of them. In this paper, we propose to use tropes as an intermediate representation of stories to approach story ideation. We present TaleStream, a canvas system that uses tropes as building blocks of stories while providing steerable suggestions of story ideas in the form of tropes. Our trope suggestion methods leverage data from the tvtropes.org wiki. We find that 97\\% of the time, trope suggestions generated by our methods provide better story ideation materials than random tropes. Our system evaluation suggests that TaleStream can support writers’ creative flow and greatly facilitates story development. Tropes, as a rich lexicon of narratives with available examples, play a key role in TaleStream and hold promise for story-creation support systems.",

      "abstract": "In the 17th century, the Cartesian coordinate system was groundbreaking. It exposed the unity between algebra and geometry, accelerating the development of the math that took humans to the moon. It was not just another concept, but a cognitive tool that people could wield to express abstract ideas in visual form, thereby expanding their capacity to think and generate new insights about a variety of other problems. Research in my lab aims to uncover the psychological mechanisms that explain how people have come to deploy these technologies in such innovative ways to learn, share knowledge, and create new things. In the first part of this talk, I will provide an overview of our recent work investigating drawing — one of our most enduring and versatile tools. Across several empirical and computational studies, I’ll argue that drawing not only provides a window into how we perceive and understand the visual world, but also accelerates humans' ability to learn and communicate useful abstractions. In the second part, I will describe an emerging line of work investigating how humans discover new abstractions when building physical structures, and externalize these abstractions to support planning and collaboration. I will close by noting the broader implications of embracing such complex, naturalistic behaviors for advancing theories of human cognition and enhancing real-world impact, including in AI and education.           Bio: Judy Fan is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. Research in her lab aims to reverse engineer the human cognitive toolkit, especially how people use physical representations of thought to learn, communicate, and solve problems. Towards this end, her lab employs converging approaches from cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. She previously held a faculty appointment at the University of California, San Diego, received her PhD in Psychology from Princeton University, and received her AB in Neurobiology and Statistics from Harvard College.",
